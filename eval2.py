# The prompt text is hardcoded into the two top-level functions below and the

#
# That's easiest to understand, and it's okay for this homework, because the
# evaluation metric is fixed and you don't need any flexibilty to change it.
# 
# But if you were trying to engineer the evaluation scheme to agree with real
# human evaluations, you would want to create many different evaluation objects
# and loop over them.

# Separate issue with the evaluation design:
# 
# Unfortunately, in the functions below, the instructions and the dialogue
# reveal the evaluee's real name.  What the evaluator gives Airhead a lower
# rating just because it's named Airhead?  Or gives Aragorn a higher rating just
# because the evaluator is an LOTR fan?
# 
# We want the evaluator to focus on the _content_ of the dialogue and not be
# unfairly biased by the evaluee's name.  So we should really replace the latter
# by a standard pseudonym throughout the prompt.  But we skipped this step for
# the homework because it would make the log messages harder for you to read.
