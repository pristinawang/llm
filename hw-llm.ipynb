That will produce much more output.  (This argument has always been available for the legacy API, and is available in the [Python bindings for open-source models such as Llama](https://pypi.org/project/llama-cpp-python/).  Those bindings also allow you to [constrain the output by an arbitrary CFG](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md), using `grammar=...`.  This is useful if you're generating code or data that must be syntactically valid to be useful to you.

    "The evaluation functions in `eval.py` asked each `EvaluationAgent` a \"warmup question\" before continuing with the real question.  That is an example of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the LLM is encouraged to talk through the problem for a few sentences before giving the answer.  CoT sometimes improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using one prompt, could you help an `LLMAgent` argubot (like Alice) do better by having think aloud before it gives an answer?  For example, each time the human speaks, your argubot (Awsom) could prompt the LLM to think about the human's ideas/motivations/personality, and to come up with a plan for how to open the human's mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might structure this as a `Dialogue` among three participants, like this:\n",

But here the argubot itself is doing it, rather than the evaluation framework.\n",
