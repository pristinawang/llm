    "Our strategy involves two parts. First, we implemented a threshold to check if the most probable sentence in kialo is similar enough. We set threshold as a parameter that we can tune later. We get the score from bm25.get_scores(). If it is bigger than our threhold we will do what akiko did which is finding the closest 3 sentences(claims) in the kialo and randomly picking one. If the score is smaller than our threshold, we try to incorporate all previous replies from the user and get the weighted average of their similarity score vectors and argmax to get the most probable sentence. The following is how we implemented that:\n",
    "\n",
    "We get each user sentences and get all their scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: user sentences[s1,s2,s3] \n",
    "scores will be score[s1], score[s2], etc\n",
    "score[s1] will be the same length as corpus\n",

    "we take these scores and multiply weight and add them together for ex: s1*0.2 s2*0.3 s3*0.5=total_s and then take argmax(total_s) and we use this as index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, get the corresponding sentence in corpus by this index. If this sentence is the same as previous sentence, we will take the total_s top 3 indexes and randomly pick one to get the sentence. The way we get weight is by using a weigth_const parameter.\n",

       "(Shorty) Agreed, flexibility shows adaptability and growth.\n",
       "(Akiki) The website says that college does make you smarter.\n",
       "(Shorty) College can enhance critical thinking.\n",

       "(Akiki) The fact that meat eating and production contributes to climate change is not an argument for complete abstention from eating meat, it is only an argument for reducing the impact of meat eating, either through reduction in per capital amounts eaten or more sustainable farming practices.\n",
       "(Shorty) Reducing meat consumption can help.\n",
       "(Akiki) The point is not to supress any human environmental effect, but to take it below the threshold at which it is harmful.\n",
       "(Shorty) Reducing harmful environmental impact is crucial.\n",
       "(Akiki) People may become environmentally complacent even if they are not vegan.\n",
       "(Shorty) Awareness is key for everyone.\n",
       "(Akiki) As poor countries grow richer and experience economic as well as cultural change, even in vegetarian-heavy places like India meat consumption is becoming more popular and vegetarianism is falling out of favor.\n",
       "(Shorty) Economic growth can influence dietary choices.\n",
       "(Akiki) Income and wealth inequality has always been an issue in the USA. It is unreasonable to expect Biden to solve it in his first year in office.\n",

    "### Awsom writeup \n",
    "Overall, our Awsom is an attempt to extend Aragorn. Awsom outperforms Aragorn when conversing with Trollface. It still follows the three main steps in retrieval-augmented generation, but with a more elaborate query formation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query formation: Awsom forms the query by paraphrasing the user’s claim into a more explicit and detailed kialo-like sentence. We get candidate queries with the following methods: \n",
    "    1. Few-shot prompting: we provide some examples of what we mean by transforming a sentence into a kialo-like claim. \n",
    "    2. Chain of thought / planning: we prompt Awsom to explain the user’s stance and reasoning. It is encouraged to plan a way to broaden the user’s mind. \n",
    "2. Retrieval step: Given the candidates queries, we ask Awsom to weigh them and tell us which resembles the user’s last response more accurately. We store the speaker’s meaning as one of the two or both. Then we fetch a similar document from Kialo. We also retrieve some pros and cons relating to the argument. \n",
    "3. Retrieval-augmented generation: Prompt the LLM to respond to the user, with the most relevant document and its pros and cons in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain of thought / planning\n",
    "Here we prompt AwsomAgent to classify the user’s response as either a question of statement. Then we encourage the LLM to explain the user’s stance and reasoning. This is a kind of CoT reasoning, as the LLM achieves a better understanding of the user’s motivation and sometimes helps with broadening the user’s mind. We use the resulting paragraph to represent the speaker’s meaning, if it is the best representation. We then find the closest document in Kialo.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Few shot prompting\n",
    "Here we prompt Awsom Agent to turn the speaker’s reply into a more explicit claim similar to a Kialo claim. To do this, we tell it not to hallucinate. More importantly, we add a sequence of messages that show example assistant-user interactions. We show the LLM what a Kialo claim is supposed to look like. For example, if a user says `DemoUser: The vegan diet is not an option for some people.`, a Kialo claim that implicitly corresponds to the user would be `A vegan diet is not well-suited for vulnerable individuals or people with lifestyles requiring specialised nutrition, who may be unable to remove animal products from their diet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt engineering on Alice \n",
    "We noticed two shortcomings from Alice. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes they don’t give a counterargument. If the user says `I hate meat eaters`, we think Alice should take a stronger stance and say meat eaters are entitled to their own dietary choices.\n",
    "- Other times, Alice just says a sentence and does not help continue the conversation. Asking more questions would help broaden the user’s mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we played around with the prompt and some things helped. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of `you're an intelligent who wants to broaden your user's mind`, we told Alice to `Disagree with the user's position.`\n",
    "    - We think this is helpful because Alice first makes a strong stance against the user.\n",
    "- We also added `and ask a question to broaden their mind`\n",
    "    - This way, Alice finishes their turn with a question and facilitates the conversation. They often suggest the user to think of the topic another way.\n",
    "- Lastly, we told Alice to be `Be factual and polite.`\n",
    "    - ChatGPT is quite thoughtful by default so we removed that part. It’s more important for Alice’s turns to be based on facts and provide a perspective that the user has not thought about.\n"

For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act were instrumental in stabilizing and strengthening the economy following the 2008 financial crisis. Additionally, some argue that many of Trump's economic decisions, such as the trade war with China and the significant tax cuts for the wealthy, had a negligible or net negative effect on the US economy.

However, there are also opposing viewpoints that highlight the \"unnatural\" steps involved in the production of vaccines, such as interfering with disease cells to create them. This raises the question of whether vaccines can truly be considered entirely natural. It's important to consider these differing perspectives when discussing the nature of vaccines.\n",

    "\n",
    "The chat completions interface allows you to sample $n$ continuations of the prompt in parallel, as we saw with \"the apples, bananas, cherries ...\" example.  This is efficient because it requires only 1 request to the LLM server and not $n$.  The latency does not scale with $n$.  Nor does the input token cost, since the prompt only has to be encoded once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you can find a way to make use of this?  For example, the query formulation step of RAG could generate $n$ implicit claims instead of just one.  We could then look for claims in the Kialo database that are close to _any_ of those implicit claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",
    "* If we sample multiple completions $(s_1,t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (s_n,t_n,r_n)$ in parallel, then we can return the $s_i$ whose $r_i$ is largest.  \n",
    "* Or if we sample $s$ and then multiple continuations $(t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (t_n,r_n)$, then we can return the mean score $\\sum_i r_i/n$ as a reduced-variance score for $s$, which averages over diverse textual evaluations that might consider different aspects of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you call the chat completions interface with $n > 1$, you specfy 1 shared input prompt and get $n$ different output completions.  Since the input prompt must be the same for all outputs``, it is necessary to sample all of $(s,t,r)$ or all of $(t,r)$ with a single call to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [here](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"
