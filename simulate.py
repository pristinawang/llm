# Remark: It would be fun to simulate a dialogue among more than two agents. 
# But then you need a protocol for deciding who gets to take the next turn!  
# An orderly rotation?  A random choice?  Or each speaker ends their turn by
# choosing the next speaker? Or they all get to speak at once, and then we
# prompt the LLM to tell us whose version was the best continuation of the
# dialogue?
