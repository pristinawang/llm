But the OpenAI messages are only labeled with the 4 special roles `user`, `assistant`, `tool`, and `system`.  Those are not quite the same thing as human speakers.  And the OpenAI messages do not necessarily form a natural-language dialogue: some of the messages are dealing with instructions, few-shot prompting, tool use, and so on.

    "* They don't respond to the user's actual statement, but to a single retrieved Kialo claim that may not accurately reflect the user's position (it just overlaps in words).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also have access to an LLM, which is able to generate new, contextually appropriate text (as Alice does).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will create an argubot named [Aragorn](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Riddle_of_Strider), who is basically the love child of Akiki and Alice, combining the high-quality specific content of Kialo with the broad competence of an LLM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG in aRAGorn's name stands for **retrieval-augmented generation**.  Aragorn is an agent that will take 3 steps to compute its `Agent.response()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query formation step**: Ask the LLM what claim should be responded to.  For\n",
    "   example, consider the following dialogue:\n",
    "    > ...\n",
    "    > Aragorn: Fortunately, the vaccine was developed in record time.\n",
    "    > Human: Sounds fishy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Sounds fishy\" is exactly the kind of statement that Akiko had trouble using\n",
    "    as a Kialo query.  But Aragorn shows the *whole dialogue* to the LLM, and\n",
    "    asks the LLM what the human's *last turn* was really saying or implying, in\n",
    "    that context. The LLM answers with a much longer statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Human [paraphrased]: A vaccine that was developed very quickly cannot be trusted.\n",
    "    > If its developers are claiming that it is safe and effective, I question their motives.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This paraphrase makes an explicit claim and can be better understood without the context.\n",
    "    It also contains many more word types, which makes it more likely that BM25 will be able\n",
    "    to find a Kialo claim with a nontrivial number of those types. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval step**: Look up claims in Kialo that are similar to the explicit\n",
    "   claim.  Create a short \"document\" that describes some of those claims and\n",
    "   their neighbors on Kialo.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval-augmented generation**: Prompt the LLM to generate the response\n",
    "   (like any `LLMAgent`).  But include the new document somewhere in the LLM\n",
    "   prompt, in a way that it influences the response. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Thus, the LLM can respond in a way that is appropriate to the dialogue but\n",

       "  (Judge Wise) Aragorn stayed on the topic fairly well. In each of his replies, he addressed the same topic that Darius was talking about in the previous sentence, which is the issue of mandatory vaccination and its impact on individual freedom and public health.),\n",
       " ((Aragorn) Do you think COVID vaccines should be mandatory?\n",
       "  (Darius) Absolutely, the overwhelming evidence shows that widespread vaccination is crucial for achieving herd immunity and preventing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.\n",
       "  (Aragorn) I believe that the idea of mandatory vaccination to achieve herd immunity is an interesting concept. On one hand, it is true that herd immunity is the most effective way to protect all members of a community from an infectious disease. Additionally, attaching vaccine requirements to attend schools or daycares has been shown to significantly increase the vaccination rate to herd immunity levels in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic has indeed caused widespread suffering, and finding a solution as quickly as possible is crucial.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  However, there are also valid concerns to consider. The distribution process of COVID-19 vaccines could indeed present a significant logistical challenge, even if the supply is not an issue. Additionally, the current dominant COVID-19 strain, Omicron, is more transmissible and generally produces mild or asymptomatic infections, which has led some public health agencies to relax restrictions despite rising cases. The possibility of reinfection and the challenge of enforcing mandatory vaccinations in the face of growing anti-vaccination sentiment are also important factors to consider.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  In order to make an informed decision about whether COVID-19 vaccines should be mandatory, it is important to consider the death tolls caused by COVID-19 rather than just the confirmed cases. We must also carefully weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of a mandatory vaccination policy, taking into account the logistical challenges and public sentiment.\n",
       "  (Darius) While I understand the logistical challenges and public sentiment surrounding mandatory vaccination, it is crucial to consider the overwhelming evidence that supports widespread vaccination as the most effective strategy to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.\n",
       "  (Aragorn) Darius, I appreciate your perspective on the importance of widespread vaccination to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19.

       "  (TrollFace) Well, that depends on your definition of \"good\" and also on your ability to differentiate between reality and fiction.\n",
       "  (Aragorn) Well, it's certainly a complex issue. On one hand, there are those who argue that Joe Biden has brought respect and professionalism back into American political life, and that the economy has done well under his presidency. Additionally, many believe that he has done a good job handling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are also valid concerns that Biden has been unable to reunite the United States after a highly divisive election, and that his policies may not be radical enough to tackle the problems facing America today. Furthermore, there are those who argue that Biden has damaged the international reputation and prestige of the United States. It's important to consider all of these perspectives before forming a judgment.\n",
       "  (TrollFace) Ah, I see, so you're saying that some people think he's great, some people think he's not so great, and some people just don't even know what to think. Sounds like a really insightful analysis of absolutely nothing.\n",
       "  (Aragorn) Well, it's certainly a complex issue. On one hand, there are valid arguments in favor of the claim that the economy has done well under Biden's presidency. For example, the expansion of the child tax credit is expected to substantially reduce child poverty in the US, and the creation of over 1.5 million jobs in the first 100 days of Biden's presidency is a positive sign. Additionally, the US economy grew at a rate of 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021, outperforming the eurozone.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  On the other hand, there are also valid concerns against this claim. Some argue that Biden is not solely responsible for the direction taken by the economy, and the skyrocketing costs of assets and commodities during his time in office are worrisome. Furthermore, the unequal economic growth under Biden, which has benefited some groups in US society but not others, is a cause for concern. The worst inflation in 40 years in 2022 and the expected erosion of consumer wealth leading to a potential recession in 2023 are also troubling indicators.\n",

       "  It's important to consider all of these perspectives before forming a judgment on the state of the economy under Biden's presidency.\n",

       "  (Aragorn) I appreciate your perspective, TrollFace. It's true that it's important to critically analyze the evidence and consider all viewpoints before forming a judgment. As for the state of the economy under Biden's presidency, I believe it's crucial to look at the data and consider the impact of his policies on different segments of society. It's important to weigh the positive indicators, such as job creation and the reduction of child poverty, against the concerns about inflation and unequal economic growth. I will continue to gather information and consider all perspectives before forming a final judgment on the matter. Thank you for the thoughtful discussion.\n",
       "  (TrollFace) Glad to see you're finally catching on to the concept of critical thinking, but you might want to speed it up a bit before the world passes you by. Keep sifting through those perspectives, and who knows, maybe one day you'll have an original thought of your own.,\n",

Some people may argue that politicians should approach the issue with an open mind, listen to the advice of experts, and make informed decisions based on the best available evidence. This is a common practice in policymaking, as it allows decision-makers to benefit from the expertise of those who have dedicated their careers to studying and understanding climate change.\n",
       "(TrollFace) Yeah, because politicians are always so open-minded and eager to listen to experts, and they never let their personal biases or political agendas get in the way of making well-informed decisions, especially when it comes to such a hot-button issue like climate change.\n",
       "(Awsom) I understand your skepticism about politicians and their understanding of important issues like climate change. It's true that not all politicians have a deep scientific background, but many of them rely on expert advice and research to inform their policies and decisions on climate change. Additionally, there are politicians who have taken the time to educate themselves on the issue and have a deep understanding of the science behind climate change. It's important to recognize that expertise and understanding can come from a variety of sources, not just a formal scientific background. Therefore, it's not accurate to make a blanket statement about the understanding of climate change among politicians.\n",

    "So, you could modify Aragorn to use tools properly.  Maybe that will help, simply because the LLM was trained on message sequences that included tool use.  It should know to pay attention to the tool portions of the prompt when they are relevant, and ignore them when they are not."

    "The chat completions interface allows you to sample $n$ continuations of the prompt in parallel, as we saw with \"the apples, bananas, cherries ...\" example.  This is efficient because it requires only 1 request to the LLM server and not $n$.  The latency does not scale with $n$.  Nor does the input token cost, since the prompt only has to be encoded once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you can find a way to make use of this?  For example, the query formulation step of RAG could generate $n$ implicit claims instead of just one.  We could then look for claims in the Kialo database that are close to _any_ of those implicit claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to do with multiple completions is to select among them or combine them.  For example, suppose we prompt the LLM to generate completions of the form $(s,t,r)$ where $s$ is an answer, $t$ evaluates that answer, and $r$ is a numerical score or reward based on that evaluation.  (\"Write a poem, then tell us about its rhyme and rhythm problems, then give your score.\")  \n",
    "* If we sample multiple completions $(s_1,t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (s_n,t_n,r_n)$ in parallel, then we can return the $s_i$ whose $r_i$ is largest.  \n",
    "* Or if we sample $s$ and then multiple continuations $(t_1,r_1), \\ldots, (t_n,r_n)$, then we can return the mean score $\\sum_i r_i/n$ as a reduced-variance score for $s$, which averages over diverse textual evaluations that might consider different aspects of $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you call the chat completions interface with $n > 1$, you specfy 1 shared input prompt and get $n$ different output completions.  Since the input prompt must be the same for all outputs``, it is necessary to sample all of $(s,t,r)$ or all of $(t,r)$ with a single call to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to reduce latency by submitting multiple requests to the server in parallel (see \"async usage\" [here](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)).  In this case the input prompts can be different, although you now have to pay to encode all of them separately.  This facility could speed up evaluation without changing its results; that's a worthwhile thing to try for extra credit!\n"
