Discussion Name:
Is Joe Biden a good President?

1. Thesis:
Joe Biden is a good president.

  1.1. Pro:
  Biden has brought respect and professionalism back into American political life.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Being more respectful and professional than Donald Trump is a low bar [1] to clear.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      The media and liberal left [2] portrayed Trump unfairly.

        1.1.1.1.1. Con:
        Many of Trump's controversies were of his own making. A number of them arose directly from his demeanour and words that he has said, such as mocking a disabled reporter [3], referring to some Neo-Nazis as very fine people [4] and degrading women in self-confessed 'locker room talk' [5], amongst other interests.

    1.1.2. Pro:
    Biden has eschewed the overly dramatic approach [6] of his predecessor, and favors a more collaborative approach [7].

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      A US president needs to collaborate with Congress [8] to successfully pass legislation and enact policies.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Collaboration [9] is a crucial component of professionlism.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    Biden has taken a strong public stance against hostility in the workplace [10] among political appointees.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      Respect for others [11] is a key element of professionalism.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    Biden has demonstrated that he respects the value of scientific research [12].

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      Biden released a memorandum outlining the position of his Administration [13] which highlights the importance of scientific evidence and integrity and commits to evidence-based policy development.

    1.1.5. Pro:
    Biden has urged Americans to show respect to each other despite political differences in his inaugural address [14] and press briefings.

      1.1.5.1. Con:
      Biden has been publicly disrespectful [15] of the GOP while overseas.

    1.1.6. Con:
    Biden acted unprofessionally [16] towards CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins.

      1.1.6.1. Con:
      Biden apologised [17] for his behaviour.

        1.1.6.1.1. Pro:
        The act of making an apology and recognising an error is a sign of professionalism and respect.

        1.1.6.1.2. Pro:
        Kaitlan Collins said his conduct did not require an apology [18].

      1.1.6.2. Pro:
      Some commentators believe Biden was rude to Kaitlan Collins because she is a woman [19].

    1.1.7. Con:
    Biden has been accused of behaving disrespectfully [20] at a ceremony honoring the 13 US service members killed during the evacuation of the Kabul airport.

      1.1.7.1. Con:
      Some have suggested that Biden was looking at his late son's rosary [21] on his wrist, not his watch.

      1.1.7.2. Con:
      Biden seems to habitually check his watch [22]. His behaviour at the ceremony was not intended as a snub to the families of the dead servive members.

      1.1.7.3. Pro:
      The White House press secretary dodged questions about his behaviour at the ceremony [23], suggesting there is no defence of his actions.

      1.1.7.4. Pro:
      Families of the fallen service members said [24] Biden disrespected their dead children by repeatedly looking at his watch.

    1.1.8. Con:
    Eight women have accused Biden of inappropriate behavior, [25] and one of these women has accused him of sexual assault.

  1.2. Con:
  Biden has been unable to reunite the United States after a highly divisive election.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    As of July 2021, 94% of Trump voters still disapproved [26] of Biden.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      Many moderate Republican voters showed support for Biden, disillusioned and upset with Trump's previous term as president [27].

      1.2.1.2. Con:
      The voters who would still support Trump after he finished his first term with the worst approval rating on record [28] are likely to be stubborn in their support for Trump and dislike of Biden.

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      A substantial majority of Trump voters still believe that Biden's win was not legitimate [29], thus they are very unlikely to ever approve of him.

        1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
        This number has remained basically unchanged [30] since January, suggesting that this view will not change with time.

        1.2.1.3.2. Con:
        If Biden stands for reelection in 2024 and wins by a more substantial majority, perhaps more people will concede that he won fairly.

          1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro:
          More people are also likely to believe the election result if Donald Trump does not run. After all, he endorsed and promoted [31] the rumours of electoral fraud.

          1.2.1.3.2.2. Con:
          This argument presumes that evidence will disprove claims of voter fraud. There is no evidence [32] of voter fraud in the 2020 election, but many people still believe that the election was rigged.

        1.2.1.3.3. Pro:
        While the evidence suggests Biden won the 2020 election, there is still a reasonable debate to be had about the fairness of the Electoral College [33].

    1.2.2. Con:
    Many of Biden's policies should appeal to Trump voters.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Biden withdrew from Afghanistan, a decision initially promoted by Trump. [34]

        1.2.2.1.1. Con:
        Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan was hasty and mismanaged [35]; the manner in which the withdrawal was executed severely limits its appeal to Trump supporters.

      1.2.2.2. Con:
      Much of Trump's appeal was not based on his policies.

        1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
        Even though Biden has continued some of Trump's policies, he is still very unpopular with Trump voters. This shows that Trump voters did not care about his policies. [36]

        1.2.2.2.2. Pro:
        Some people voted for Trump because they wanted to wreck the political system [37].

        1.2.2.2.3. Con:
        Trump's presidency saw the effective implementation of many core Republican policies.

          1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro:
          Betsy DeVos, Trump's Education Secretary, ensured that faith-based organisations had a more significant role [38] in schooling.

          1.2.2.2.3.2. Con:
          Republicans traditionally want less state expenditure. Trump's administration oversaw increasing annual budget deficits [39] every year he was in office.

      1.2.2.3. Pro:
      Biden has, like Trump, retained a hard-line stance on China.

        1.2.2.3.1. Pro:
        Biden has not lifted Trump-era tariffs on China [40].

        1.2.2.3.2. Con:
        Biden initiated [41] a phone call with Xi Jinping, the president of China. The two leaders agreed that their states would not "veer into conflict" and that they would discuss their interests "openly and straightforwardly" [42].

      1.2.2.4. Con:
      Biden's reversal of key Trump policies [43] was certain to disenfranchise Trump voters.

    1.2.3. Con:
    The US is more deeply divided over politics [44] than at any point in the last twenty years. It is unrealistic to expect Biden alone to heal this divide.

      1.2.3.1. Con:
      Many people credit Donald Trump with drastically deepening this divide [45]. If one man can make this division so much worse, surely one man can also heal it.

        1.2.3.1.1. Con:
        Sowing division based on populist rhetoric, insults and hyperbole is easy, as seen by Trump's success [46]. Fixing the issues caused by this division requires significant effort and compromise.

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        The divisions Trump exposed existed long before his election [47].

        1.2.3.1.3. Pro:
        Biden put healing political divisions [48] at the centre of his inaugural speech.

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      Believing that Biden can single-handedly fix US political divisions suggests a "great man theory" perspective on politics which many historians now reject or only accept with qualifications [49].

      1.2.3.3. Pro:
      Studies have identified a number of profound and persistent ideological divides [50] between Biden and Trump voters. Such deep-seated distrust cannot be easily resolved.

    1.2.4. Con:
    Biden should not try to unite the US [51]. People like those who broke into the Capitol building [52] should not be courted, no matter how divided the country is.

      1.2.4.1. Con:
      The groups who broke into the Capitol building were a small minority who faced condemnation from Democrats [53] and Republicans [54] alike.

      1.2.4.2. Con:
      As wrong and widely condemned as the Capitol riots were, it is this 'us versus them' thinking that lead to the division and polarization in the first place.

      1.2.4.3. Pro:
      The illegal actions of groups that represent white supremacy and insurrection should never be legitimised by the President of the United States.

        1.2.4.3.1. Pro:
        The agendas of violent white nationalist and anti-government extremist groups [55] in the US are incompatible with democracy.

    1.2.5. Pro:
    Biden’s approval rating has dropped [56] over the past two months, and remains deeply divided by political affiliation.

      1.2.5.1. Con:
      This is probably a short-term reaction to Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan [57]. In the long term, most voters care less about foreign policy than domestic issues [58].

        1.2.5.1.1. Con:
        Foreign policy disasters can still destroy a presidency. Lyndon B. Johnson's catastrophic record in Vietnam [59] was probably why he didn't stand for reelection in 1969.

        1.2.5.1.2. Pro:
        George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003, an increasingly unpopular [60] decision by the time of the next election in November 2004. He still won a second term of office.

      1.2.5.2. Pro:
      More than half [61] (51%) of the US electorate now disapprove of Biden's performance as president.

  1.3. Con:
  Biden has not introduced policies that are sufficiently radical to tackle the problems facing America today.

    1.3.1. Pro:
    Biden has not taken radical action to resolve immigration issues [62] at the US border.

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      The action that Biden has taken has been met with resistance, legal action, and threats by Republican governors [63].

        1.3.1.1.1. Con:
        The actions opposed constitute placement of illegal aliens throughout the US; in no way do these solve or attempt to solve the issues at the border.

      1.3.1.2. Pro:
      In September 2021 the Biden administration's top envoy to Haiti [64] resigned after "inhumane", "horrible and horrific" [65] images emerged of Haitian immigrants being chased by Border Patrol agents on horseback after attempting to cross the Rio Grande.

        1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
        The Biden administration's response to this incident was to halt the use of horses by Border Patrol agents in this area [66]. This is a shallow response and indicative of the Biden administration's unwillingness to take radical action on polarising issues.

          1.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
          Immigration is a highly partisan issue [67], and Biden is already being accused of allowing “uncontrolled illegal immigration into the country, [68]”. Taking stronger action would risk further angering Republican State actors and lawmakers.

          1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          The only substantive change this will make is that instead of being chased on horseback, vulnerable immigrants will now be chased by off road vehicles or on foot instead.

        1.3.1.2.2. Con:
        Whilst the means may be problematic, migrants must be stopped from entering the US illegally.

          1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          In May alone the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) caught over 180,000 migrants at the US-Mexico border. This surge has been blamed on President Biden's more relaxed immigration policies by Republican lawmakers and foreign leaders. [69]

          1.3.1.2.2.2. Con:
          Many of these migrants, particularly from Haiti, a nation ravaged by earthquakes and storms [70], are fleeing poverty and life-threatening conditions. This makes them refugees and not merely economic migrants.

      1.3.1.3. Pro:
      Biden has not pursued the decriminalisation of illegal US border crossings [71].

    1.3.2. Pro:
    President Biden has not followed through on his promise to make human rights [72] a central policy issue.

      1.3.2.1. Pro:
      Biden has not fulfilled his vow to address systemic racism in America by failing to combat proposed voter restriction laws [73] that erode the voting rights of minorities.

      1.3.2.2. Pro:
      Biden oversaw the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, which abandoned Afghan women to a life of oppression [74] under the Taliban.

      1.3.2.3. Con:
      Biden has told Vladimir Putin that if opposition leader Alexei Navalny [75] is harmed, Russia will face devastating consequences.

      1.3.2.4. Con:
      Biden has enforced protections [76] for LGBTQ individuals accessing healthcare.

      1.3.2.5. Pro:
      Many Americans still struggle to access healthcare due to the prohibitive price of medical care in the US [77].

        1.3.2.5.1. Pro:
        Americans have a collective medical debt of $140 billion. [78]

        1.3.2.5.2. Pro:
        Studies have found that 66% of US bankruptcies were tied to medical issues [79], with debt accruing either because of the cost of care or loss of work.

        1.3.2.5.3. Con:
        The Biden administration's 'American Rescue Plan' has lowered premiums for insurance received through the Affordable Care Act [80].

          1.3.2.5.3.1. Pro:
          The Biden administration has also advocated for increased Medicare coverage [81], adding comprehensive dental, vision and hearing services to Medicare.

          1.3.2.5.3.2. Con:
          Many [82] Democrats left of Biden support a single-payer Medicare-for-all plan [83] as a solution to medical inaccessibility in the US.

            1.3.2.5.3.2.1. Con:
            A Medicare-for-all bill has not cleared a single committee before [84], and will not clear Congress. Biden's plan is more pragmatic and popular.

            1.3.2.5.3.2.2. Pro:
            Bernie Sanders ran on a platform of providing a generous Medicare-for-all plan [85] that would provide free healthcare for all Americans.

              1.3.2.5.3.2.2.1. Con:
              The Medicare-for-all plans proposed by candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders would have been prohibitively expensive [86].

                1.3.2.5.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
                Whilst federal spending on healthcare would increase massively, the overall healthcare spending in the US would likely be reduced slightly [87].

    1.3.3. Pro:
    Biden has failed to fully embrace existing radical policy initiatives.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      Biden has not supported Medicare-for-all [88].

        1.3.3.1.1. Con:
        Although Biden's health plan does not include Medicare-for-all, it still includes radical elements, such as removing the ban on federal funding of abortions [89] that has been in place for decades.

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      Biden has not supported the Green New Deal [90].

        1.3.3.2.1. Con:
        Biden's environmental plan and goals are influenced by the Green New Deal [91] and support its ideals.

    1.3.4. Con:
    Biden has introduced ambitious climate change policies.

      1.3.4.1. Con:
      Given the nature and scope of the environmental issues facing the US, Biden's plan is not ambitious enough [92].

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      Biden's greenhouse gas policy [93] calls for a 50-52% reduction in net greenhouse gas pollution from 2005 levels by 2030.

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      On January 20, 2021, Biden issued an executive order [94] on public health and the environment.

        1.3.4.3.1. Con:
        Executive orders are not as durable [95] as other regulations. An incoming president could overturn an order [96] as contentious as the one on public health and the environment.

        1.3.4.3.2. Pro:
        The order directs all executive departments and agencies to review all actions taken between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021 [97] to identify any actions with a negative impact on public health or environmental protection. It also empowers the Attorney General with the power to dispose of litigation over such actions and seek appropriate relief to strategically support ongoing plaintiff-driven climate litigation [98] against polluters.

        1.3.4.3.3. Pro:
        The order revoked the March 2019 permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline [99], which was subsequently cancelled.

    1.3.5. Pro:
    The United States is facing serious, existential issues relating to domestic terrorism and the alt-right [100], white supremacy [101], the environment [102] and international relations.

    1.3.6. Con:
    Biden has come into power during a political and public health crisis: his ability to take radical action is diminished by this.

      1.3.6.1. Con:
      Times of crisis, upheaval and questioning of societal structures and norms [103], as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, can be an opportunity to enact radical changes [104].

        1.3.6.1.1. Pro:
        The last great global societal disruption, WWII, allowed for significant and lasting social and economic policy changes, such as the foundation of the NHS in Britain [105] and the GI Bill in the US [106], inter alia.

        1.3.6.1.2. Con:
        Some of those radical changes can be disastrous. The Great Depression helped propel the Nazis into power [107].

      1.3.6.2. Pro:
      As the successor to a highly controversial and divisive President, Biden has to create stability and unity in the US before he can enact change.

      1.3.6.3. Pro:
      Considering the scale of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy [108], it is necessary that Biden establish a stable economic foundation before radical action can be taken on social and environmental issues, as radical action can be expensive or disruptive to the economy.

    1.3.7. Con:
    The idea that only radical policies can resolve the issues facing America is a hasty generalization [109]. Even if this is true for some issues, it does not follow that all issues share this characteristic.

      1.3.7.1. Pro:
      Radical policies in American politics can often result in political gridlock. A moderate approach [110] to some issues may prove to be more effective.

        1.3.7.1.1. Pro:
        Radical gun control legislation would be very unlikely to pass [111] in the current 50-50 US Senate [112].

          1.3.7.1.1.1. Con:
          Despite the lack of a strong majority, the current political climate offers one of the best opportunities in recent times to enact gun control legislation [113].

          1.3.7.1.1.2. Pro:
          Biden has already failed [114] to install David Chipman, a gun control activist, as the head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

        1.3.7.1.2. Pro:
        Biden is already facing resistance from some state governments and governors on COVID-19 requirements [115]. Radical policies would only widen the federal-state government divide in some areas, and risk undermining his presidency.

        1.3.7.1.3. Con:
        Radical policies are more popular with the general public than with legislators [116]. If politicians want to stay in office they will vote for popular radical policies.

        1.3.7.1.4. Con:
        Barack Obama's moderation of his healthcare package to court Republican support failed in 2008-2010 [117]. The cause of gridlock is not how moderate the policies are but the increased polarisation of American party politics.

      1.3.7.2. Pro:
      The radicalization of the Democratic party is likely to further widen the political divide [118] in American politics.

    1.3.8. Con:
    Biden's FY 2022 [119] budget would take the United States to its highest sustained levels of federal spending since World War II [120].

      1.3.8.1. Con:
      Biden's budget is not radical, but is instead a response to longstanding withdrawal and neglect [121] of important issues by the federal government.

      1.3.8.2. Pro:
      The US spent 4.1 trillion inflation-adjusted dollars [122] during World War II.

      1.3.8.3. Pro:
      The budget proposal [123] calls for a $6 trillion budget, with total spending rising to $8.2 trillion by 2031.

        1.3.8.3.1. Pro:
        The $2 trillion American Jobs Plan [124] includes provisions to improve infrastructure, address climate change and racial inequality, and raise corporate taxes.

        1.3.8.3.2. Pro:
        The $1 trillion American Families Plan [125] is focused on improving American social safety by expanding access to education, reducing the cost of child care, and supporting women in the work force.

      1.3.8.4. Con:
      High levels of federal spending are not a problem.

        1.3.8.4.1. Pro:
        Austerity policies in other states, such as the United Kingdom, have failed [126].

        1.3.8.4.2. Con:
        High levels of public spending will not incentivise the private sector [127] to innovate and solve the challenges facing the United States.

      1.3.8.5. Pro:
      US Senator Marco Rubio has characterised Biden's FY 2022 budget [128] as a radical, partisan power grab [129].

  1.4. Pro:
  The economy has done well under Biden's presidency.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    Biden has expanded the child tax credit [130], which will substantially reduce child poverty [131] in the US.

      1.4.1.1. Con:
      The Nixon administration attempted a similar policy in the late 1960s [132] but could not get it past Congress. Biden may not be able to get his policy extended [133] to 2025 as he wishes.

        1.4.1.1.1. Con:
        Such a legislative gridlock is more indicative of a failure within the American political system than of issues arising from the Biden administration.

          1.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
          A President must work pragmatically. If his policies are not popular enough to get past Congress, then that is a failure of the president to not compromise on his policy or gather enough support.

            1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.2.1.

            1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
            Executive orders (which allow a president to make laws without consulting Congress [134]) enable a president to make changes without compromising their policies through the legislative process.

              1.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
              Executive orders are controversial [135]. If Biden uses them excessively, it may impact his reputation among his supporters.

              1.4.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
              Precedent is being set for presidents to make extensive use of executive orders. Both Obama and Trump signed hundreds [136] of them.

          1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro:
          Congress has concurrently passed fewer bills year-on-year [137], and the ratio of bills passed to bills introduced has reached as low as 0.059 [138] this decade.

        1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
        Some Democrats believe that there should be a work requirement [139] added in order to be eligible for expanded tax credit payments, an idea with which proponents of the credit strongly disagree. If Democrats cannot come to an agreement, the policy will not be enacted.

      1.4.1.2. Con:
      Republicans such as Marco Rubio are concerned that the child tax credit will disincentivise people in poverty to find work [140].

        1.4.1.2.1. Con:
        Less child poverty is always a good outcome. If people have to be motivated to work by the threat of starving their children, then there are bigger issues than child tax credits at work.

        1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
        There is research to support the belief that a child tax credit will lead to a decline in employment [141].

      1.4.1.3. Pro:
      59% of the US population [142] support the child tax credit, including 41% of Republicans.

      1.4.1.4. Pro:
      Three million [143] children are currently not in poverty thanks to Biden’s child tax credit.

      1.4.1.5. Con:
      Biden's child tax credits are too expensive [144] for the US government. There will ultimately be more child poverty if the country goes bankrupt from overspending on social policies.

    1.4.2. Pro:
    More than 1.5 million jobs were created in the first 100 days [145] of Biden's presidency.

      1.4.2.1. Con:
      Biden’s claim of 1.5 million jobs created is misleading as many of those jobs were preexisting jobs [146] left vacant due to lockdowns.

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      Biden's figure is significantly higher than the 600,000 [147] Trump claimed in the same period of his presidency.

      1.4.2.3. Con:
      Measuring success by the first 100 days of a presidency is arbitrary [148]. Significant progress takes much longer to appear.

      1.4.2.4. Pro:
      This is the highest number of jobs created [149] during the first 100 days of any recorded US presidency.

    1.4.3. Con:
    Biden is not responsible for the direction taken by the economy.

      1.4.3.1. Pro:
      The economy is made up of the actions of millions of people trading with one another; the ways they are helped and hindered by Biden are relatively minuscule.

        1.4.3.1.1. Pro:
        A landmark Princeton study in 2016 [150] found that, while the economy has historically grown more under Democratic than Republican administrations, "our empirical analysis does not attribute any of the partisan growth gap to fiscal or monetary policy [151]."

        1.4.3.1.2. Con:
        While all citizens participate in the economy, their actions are regulated and limited [152] by the ruling government. As such, the government is at least partially responsible for economic growth during their time in office.

      1.4.3.2. Con:
      Although presidential actions have relatively little influence on the economy during normal times, during a crisis [153], such as the coronavirus pandemic, the actions of a president can have significant economic effects.

        1.4.3.2.1. Con:
        The pandemic was mostly over by the time Biden came into office.

    1.4.4. Pro:
    In the first quarter of 2021, the US economy grew at a rate of 6.4%, compared to a 0.6% drop observed in the eurozone [154].

      1.4.4.1. Con:
      Biden inherited an economy that was performing well prior to the pandemic [155]. As restrictions ease [156], the US economy, which is based on consumers [157], will be subject to a rebound.

        1.4.4.1.1. Pro:
        Professional economists tend to attribute economic trends in the first three months [158] of a president's term to the previous administration. This should also be the case here.

        1.4.4.1.2. Con:
        The economic success of the Trump administration was continuing a trend [159] started by Obama.

      1.4.4.2. Pro:
      If the IMF projection of 7% GDP growth [160] for the US in 2021 proves accurate, this will be the largest single-year growth since 1984 [161].

      1.4.4.3. Pro:
      Biden's three-prong economic approach [162], which features massive stimulus, toleration of high inflation and mass savings, is unprecedented since the Second World War. He deserves personal credit for the economy's success.

      1.4.4.4. Con:
      Globalised economies are complex, and presidents have less control over them [163] than most people think. Successes or failures in the economy happen independently of a particular president's policy.

    1.4.5. Con:
    Asset [164] and commodity [165] costs have skyrocketed during Biden's time in office.

      1.4.5.1. Pro:
      The wide-ranging government stimulus and relief measures [166] passed by Biden will increase inflation and further threaten a recovering US economy [167].

      1.4.5.2. Con:
      Such increased costs are an unavoidable consequence of the closure of production [168] and supply lines [169] caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        1.4.5.2.1. Pro:
        Low supply caused by the disruptions of various COVID-19 measures, paired with high demand as the economy reopens will cause prices to rise until either demand drops or supply rises.

        1.4.5.2.2. Con:
        Biden could have avoided much of the economic hardship and price increases by taking a more economically responsible and business-cognizant COVID-19 strategy.

    1.4.6. Con:
    The economic growth under Biden has been unequal, benefiting some groups in US society, but not others.

      1.4.6.1. Pro:
      Female participation in the labour force is at its lowest since 1988 [170].

        1.4.6.1.1. Con:
        The high rate of female unemployment is related to systematic inequalities in the US labor force [171], which resulted in a larger proportion of women in jobs and industries more vulnerable to economic fluctuation.

        1.4.6.1.2. Pro:
        Biden's plan for women [172] has failed to address the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on female employment and the latent gender inequality [173] present in many industries.

      1.4.6.2. Pro:
      BIPOC communities have suffered greater financial difficulties [174] due to COVID-related economic changes.

        1.4.6.2.1. Con:
        BIPOC communities have been shown to be more vulnerable [175] to economic changes [176] and downturn [177]. This is an issue that any President would have faced and is not related to Biden's actions as President.

      1.4.6.3. Con:
      Income and wealth inequality has always been an issue in the USA [178]. It is unreasonable to expect Biden to solve it in his first year in office.

    1.4.7. Con:
    In 2022, Americans faced the worst inflation in 40 years [179], and the resulting erosion of consumer wealth is expected to result in a recession in 2023 [180].

  1.5. Pro:
  Biden has done a good job handling the COVID-19 pandemic.

    1.5.1. Pro:
    Biden responded to the surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the spread of the delta variant with a large-scale action plan [181].

      1.5.1.1. Pro:
      Biden's plan expanded the loan program for small businesses [182] affected by the pandemic.

        1.5.1.1.1. Con:
        Small businesses do not need such drastic help. While some are struggling, a recent survey found that 63% of small businesses [183] are optimistic about their 2021 performance.

        1.5.1.1.2. Pro:
        The US Chamber of Commerce, who rarely support Democratic proposals, supported Biden's loan program [184].

      1.5.1.2. Con:
      The vaccine mandate elements of Biden's action plan are morally and legally problematic.

        1.5.1.2.1. Con:
        Offering private employees a choice between vaccination or compulsory testing [185] offers significant potential health benefits.

        1.5.1.2.2. Con:
        It is appropriate for the state to limit an individual’s liberty if their freedom would put others at risk [186].

        1.5.1.2.3. Pro:
        77% of adults in the US have had at least one vaccine. If this trend continues, this could be enough to reach herd immunity [187] without mandatory vaccination.

        1.5.1.2.4. Pro:
        Mandatory vaccination undermines the concept of body sovereignty [188], which is the foundation of individual rights.

          1.5.1.2.4.1. Pro:
          Denial of body sovereignty is characteristic of authoritarianism [189].

          1.5.1.2.4.2. Con:
          Individual rights have always been sacrificable in the name of the public good at times of emergency [190].

        1.5.1.2.5. Pro:
        The creation of government-mandated vaccination programs will assist in recruitment for the anti-vaccine [191] movement.

        1.5.1.2.6. Pro:
        Mandatory vaccination programs are inherently discriminatory. [192]

        1.5.1.2.7. Pro:
        Since vaccination is a medical intervention that carries a risk of injury or death, people have a right to informed consent [193] to vaccinations.

          1.5.1.2.7.1. Con:
          Informed consent is inappropriate [194] and irrelevant in the context of an obligatory vaccination program.

          1.5.1.2.7.2. Con:
          The risks of the various COVID-19 vaccines are mild [195], especially compared to those of contracting COVID-19.

        1.5.1.2.8. Pro:
        A vaccine mandate on businesses that operate completely within one state, and on employees aside from their role as travelers [196] or users of interstate commerce [197] exceeds the enumerated powers of the US federal government.

      1.5.1.3. Pro:
      Mandatory vaccination for federal, healthcare, and education workers is ethically justified.

        1.5.1.3.1. Pro:
        Most of the people in these jobs have to work through lockdowns [198]. It is unethical to expose them to unvaccinated coworkers at times of heightened transmission.

        1.5.1.3.2. Pro:
        Vaccinated infected people seem less likely to pass on the virus [199] than unvaccinated people. Vaccination should therefore be part of healthcare workers’ ethical responsibility towards their patients.

        1.5.1.3.3. Pro:
        The federal government is an employer just as private companies are, therefore it should have the right to dictate who it chooses to employ. This is particularly salient when unvaccinated coworkers may endanger their colleagues.

    1.5.2. Pro:
    Biden has supported a science-based approach [200] to handling the coronavirus pandemic, and continues to reassess his policies based on the opinions of medical experts [201].

      1.5.2.1. Pro:
      Scientists have welcomed [202] Biden's new approach as an improvement over Trump's.

      1.5.2.2. Con:
      Some scientists argue that Biden's science-based approach still needs more detail and solutions to key problems [203], such as getting tests to people who can't go to test centres.

      1.5.2.3. Con:
      Biden's science-based approach depends on people getting vaccinated voluntarily [204] but almost two in ten [205] Americans say they will never get the vaccine. This suggests Biden's administration has not considered behavioural science research [206] into vaccine hesitancy when developing their approach.

    1.5.3. Con:
    Biden has failed to address the rise in dangerous misinformation [207] about COVID-19 vaccines.

      1.5.3.1. Con:
      The right to freedom of speech is enshrined within American law [208], culture and political belief. It would be very difficult for Biden to address rampant misinformation without curtailing this right.

        1.5.3.1.1. Con:
        Addressing dangerous misinformation does not require restricting freedom of speech, but rather it could be done by educating communities and rebuilding trust in medical authorities.

          1.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
          US government websites contain ample scientifically-backed sources of information [209]. There is only so much that the Federal Government can do without restricting freedom of speech and the dissemination of misinformation.

          1.5.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          The US has a very low level of trust in health authorities [210] such as the CDC, according to polls.

        1.5.3.1.2. Con:
        Many of the platforms where misinformation is spread are not public spaces but privately owned software with agreed terms of use [211]. Biden could bring pressure to bear on those companies to enforce their own rules as they did in the case of Trump's Twitter account [212].

        1.5.3.1.3. Pro:
        Lots of disinformation is political, and political free speech is at the core of the First Amendment [213].

        1.5.3.1.4. Con:
        Speech that results in a "clear and present danger [214]" is not protected by the First Amendment. During a pandemic, vaccine misinformation may fit this criteria.

      1.5.3.2. Con:
      Critical issues around COVID-19 such as the wearing of face masks, vaccine efficacy and the severity of the illness, have become partisan issues [215]. This makes it incredibly hard for a Democrat president to influence Republican voters, particularly when Biden has faced resistance from Republican governors [216].

    1.5.4. Con:
    Biden's intelligence review was unable to reach a conclusive assessment on the origin of the COVID-19 virus [217].

      1.5.4.1. Con:
      As the virus originated in China, Biden's intelligence is limited by what the Chinese authorities will reveal, which is very little [218].

        1.5.4.1.1. Con:
        Biden should be using the significant political and military power that the US wields in order to secure a thorough investigation into the origin of the virus.

        1.5.4.1.2. Pro:
        Considering the political sensitivity of the issue, and the delicate nature of Sino-US relations, it would be prudent for Biden to allow an independent body such as the WHO investigate the origins of the virus [219].

    1.5.5. Con:
    Biden has not yet come up with a workable plan to address racial and ethnic disparities in the effects of the coronavirus pandemic [220].

      1.5.5.1. Con:
      Biden's Executive Order on Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery [221] attempts to address the challenge of vaccine hesitancy in BIPOC communities.

        1.5.5.1.1. Pro:
        Current vaccination data [222] shows that a growing share of vaccinations are going to BIPOC communities. Between March 1, 2021 and September 20, 2021 the percentage of vaccinations going to Hispanic people increased in every state reporting data and increased for Black people in most of the reporting states.

      1.5.5.2. Pro:
      The persistence of racial discrepancies in COVID-19 death statistics [223] show that Biden's plan is not adequately addressing the issue.

        1.5.5.2.1. Con:
        Generations of racism and medical experimentation upon BIPOC in the US [224] has lead to a deep generational mistrust of health authorities and services [225]. It is unrealistic to expect the Biden administration to fix this in a year.

    1.5.6. Con:
    156,000 people died of COVID-19 [226] during Biden's first 14 weeks in office.

      1.5.6.1. Pro:
      The highest day of deaths in the US (12 February 2021, 5,463 deaths) [227] occurred when Biden was in office.

        1.5.6.1.1. Con:
        Biden was only inaugurated on 20 January 2021, and COVID-19 rates rose steeply [228] in the weeks before he took office.

        1.5.6.1.2. Pro:
        Deaths began rising again in August and September 2021. Death rates are now as high [229] as in April-June 2020, when many people criticised Donald Trump for mishandling the pandemic [230].

        1.5.6.1.3. Con:
        President Biden has faced difficulty in effectively handling COVID-19 due to resistance from Republican state governors [231] (e.g., vaccine and mask mandates) and citizen groups. This limits not only his ability to handle the crisis but also his responsibility for the consequences.

      1.5.6.2. Con:
      The cited article states that there was a drastic decline [232] in the death rate after President Biden assumed office.

      1.5.6.3. Con:
      -> See 1.5.6.1.3.

    1.5.7. Pro:
    Biden has overseen one of the most expansive vaccination programs in the world.

      1.5.7.1. Con:
      China, the EU, and India have manufactured more COVID-19 vaccine doses [233] than the US.

        1.5.7.1.1. Con:
        Vaccine manufacture rates are irrelevant as long as there is ample supply. Many States have a massive surplus of vaccine doses [234].

      1.5.7.2. Con:
      The USA has a vaccination rate of only 54% [235], compared to rates of 71% and 63% [236] in countries like China and Germany respectively.

        1.5.7.2.1. Con:
        It is not reasonable to compare vaccine uptake in democratic countries, where people can choose whether to get vaccinated, and modern authoritarian states [237].

        1.5.7.2.2. Pro:
        Many of those who are currently not vaccinated are refusing to do so [238]. It is unlikely that the president will be able to convince these people.

      1.5.7.3. Pro:
      As of August 3, 2021, the US had delivered 110 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to 65 countries [239], more than the combined total of every other country making donations.

  1.6. Con:
  Biden has damaged the international reputation and prestige of the United States.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    Biden's choice to withdraw from Afghanistan has led to the international humiliation of the United States.

      1.6.1.1. Con:
      The situation in Afghanistan was an embarrassment for the US long before Biden became president [240]. His decision to withdraw addresses this issue, but certainly did not create it.

      1.6.1.2. Con:
      President Biden was bound by a Trump-era deal with the Taliban [241] to withdraw from Afghanistan.

        1.6.1.2.1. Con:
        Even within the specifications of the deal, the withdrawal could have been managed better, for example by better foreseeing and preparing for the consequences of America's disengagement.

          1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          The American failure to foresee the fast collapse of the Afghan government has been attributed [242] to intelligence failures across multiple government agencies.

          1.6.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          Biden war partly on vacation [243] during the withdrawal phase.

      1.6.1.3. Con:
      The damage to the United States' reputation has been exaggerated. In some countries (France and Canada), favourable opinions of the US actually increased [244] after Biden's withdrawal.

        1.6.1.3.1. Con:
        In the United Kingdom, one of the United States' key allies, approval of the US fell by ten percentage points [245].

        1.6.1.3.2. Pro:
        Many people believe that the United States should not police the world [246]. The US pulling out of Afghanistan should be popular with those people.

      1.6.1.4. Pro:
      Biden's withdrawal doomed the Afghan people to live under the Taliban, making a mockery of his claim to put human rights [247] at the forefront of his government policy.

      1.6.1.5. Pro:
      Biden's additional refusal to extend the 31 August deadline for US troops to exit Kabul [248], despite the request of their allies: the French, Italian and British government, further sullied the reputation of the US as a strong ally and world leader.

    1.6.2. Pro:
    Biden has mismanaged US-EU relations.

      1.6.2.1. Pro:
      The failure to consult EU member states when creating a new Indo-Pacific strategy with the UK and Australia caused financial and diplomatic harm to the EU [249] and caused them to question the "transparency and loyalty [250]" of America.

      1.6.2.2. Con:
      A small number of diplomatic incidents do not constitute mismanagement, particularly when the US and EU have been such important long-term allies [251].

      1.6.2.3. Con:
      Biden is far more liked in the EU [252] than Trump.

      1.6.2.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.6.1.5.

    1.6.3. Con:
    Biden has done a good job rehabilitating the image of the United States left behind by his predecessor, President Trump.

      1.6.3.1. Pro:
      President Trump and his 'America First' severely weakened the image of the US as a world leader, and lead to the withdrawal of the US from a number of multilateral agreements [253] and collapsed confidence in the US abroad [254].

      1.6.3.2. Pro:
      Biden has renewed the US commitment to multilateralism and diplomatic agreements.

        1.6.3.2.1. Con:
        -> See 1.2.2.3.1.

        1.6.3.2.2. Pro:
        Biden's decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement [255] has helped to restore US credibility.

        1.6.3.2.3. Pro:
        One of President Biden's first acts as President was rejoining the World Health Organisation [256] after his predecessor, President Trump, withdrew membership and funding [257].

        1.6.3.2.4. Pro:
        The Biden administration has revived arms control efforts, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear weapons capabilities [258].

        1.6.3.2.5. Con:
        The US withdrawal from Afghanistan was undiplomatic and left US allies feeling betrayed and angered [259].

      1.6.3.3. Con:
      The Biden Administration has acted too slowly in reversing the effects of Trump's policies on the State Department [260] and has been hesitant to make bold policy decisions.

        1.6.3.3.1. Pro:
        The policies of the Trump Administration severely damaged the the State Department's capacity to effectively carry out diplomacy [261].

        1.6.3.3.2. Con:
        Biden has taken action to rebuild the State Department [262] by restoring experienced diplomats, making new appointments and expressing his commitment to support US diplomats.

    1.6.4. Pro:
    The Biden administration's attitude to global vaccine relief has damaged the reputation of the US.

      1.6.4.1. Pro:
      President Biden echoed Trump's damaging 'America First' policy by announcing that Americans would be eligible for a third COVID vaccine 'booster' dose, despite the WHO calling for a moratorium on booster jabs as many people worldwide are yet to receive their first dose [263].

      1.6.4.2. Pro:
      Biden resisted encouraging the EU to waiving the TRIPS agreement [264], which would allow struggling nations to develop and manufacture generic versions of the COVID vaccine.

      1.6.4.3. Con:
      The Biden administration showed US support for a WTO waiver on the TRIPS agreement [265] for COVID vaccines, which would allow for the development of generic vaccines and greater vaccination rates in developing economies. [266]

      1.6.4.4. Con:
      -> See 1.5.7.3.

"In an October 2016 editorial, The Atlantic wrote of Donald Trump: “He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar.” We argued that Trump “expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself.” Trump, we also noted, “is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America’s nuclear arsenal.

The move: DeVos tweaked a wide range of federal education policies, large and small, to bolster faith-based organizations. She changed regulations, for example, to make it easier for members of religious orders to access federal financial aid and expanded federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness to cover clergy members. And she created new protections for faith-based campus organizations at public universities.

At the K-12 education level, DeVos stopped enforcing a policy that had prohibited religious organizations from providing publicly funded services—such as tutoring, technology and counseling—in private schools. And she opened up federal grants for charter schools to religiously affiliated organizations."

"President Joe Biden on Wednesday offered a message of healing for the country and hope for the future after he was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.

Biden, the former vice president under President Barack Obama, enters office amid a raging pandemic and with Americans more divided than ever, save for the Civil War era.

Standing before a reduced, socially-distanced crowd, all surrounded by a militarized U.S. Capitol due to the Jan. 6 insurrection, Biden offered a stark contrast of his version of America than that of his predecessor four years ago.

“This is America’s day, this is democracy’s day,” Biden said, after being introduced with First Lady Dr. Jill Biden. “A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy."

"Does anyone still believe in the Great Man theory of history, except perhaps for Boris Johnson, who clearly wants us to believe in it, whatever he privately hopes and fears? The theory’s obvious problem is that it blatantly excludes not just women, but the billions of other men who have peopled this planet and without whom ‘history’ would not exist. The question raises philosophical issues of the individual versus the collective and freewill versus determinism and has often become an ideological shibboleth. But most historians grafting away in the archives will end up taking a position of pragmatic compromise, which acknowledges the power of individuals but makes sense of it through contextualisation."

"A strong majority of Trump voters see no real difference between Democrats and socialists, and a majority of Biden voters at least somewhat agree that there is no real difference between Republicans and fascists.

 Significant numbers of both Trump and Biden voters show a willingness to consider violating democratic tendencies and norms if needed to serve their priorities. Roughly 2 in 10 Trump and Biden voters strongly agree it would be better if a “President could take needed actions without being constrained by Congress or courts,” and roughly 4 in 10 (41%) of Biden and half (52%) of Trump voters at least somewhat agree that it’s time to split the country, favoring blue/red states seceding from the union."

Never mind the fact a sizable portion of them are committed to contesting the results even if that happens. For the last four years, many have developed a taste for punishing people, reclaiming an imaginary lost mantle atop American society. They have shown little sign of repentance. Trump’s shamelessness has removed any veneer of shared interests between the two dominating parties in America, between people who have accepted his vision for America, such as it is, and those who have rejected it. It’s not just the Trump base Biden needs to win over, but its victims."

In his book On Treason: A Citizen’s Guide to the Law, Larson argued that Americans were unlikely to mount an internal rebellion against the United States in modern times. Then the Capitol attack proved him wrong.

What was distinctive about the Capitol riot, he said, was the use of force, which is necessary for something to count as “levying war” against the United States.

He compared the insurrection to the anti-tax Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, which was forcefully put down by George Washington, and resulted in multiple indictments for treason.

“If you asked a lawyer in 1790 if [6 January] was an act of treason or levying war against the United States, they would have almost certainly said yes,” Larson said."

Considering the president’s vast authority to shape the world, the fact that global affairs are discussed so rarely raises real questions about the country’s priorities.

Foreign policy isn’t only neglected in the debates, but by ordinary voters as well. In a December 2019 Gallup poll, U.S. adults were asked to name the most important issues influencing their vote in the 2020 presidential election. Of 16 issues presented, the five most important issues were healthcare, national security, gun policy, education and the economy. Missing from that list? Foreign affairs and international trade, which only 21 percent and 18 percent of those polled said were the most important issues, respectively."

"By the fall of 1967, Johnson had one last opportunity to save his presidency and end the war. Instead he continued to mislead American people about how Vietnam was going and the nature of the enemy threat - an effort capped off by General William Westmoreland's famous 'light at the end of the tunnel' speech. The result was that he hopelessly divided the Democratic Party (a rift that has never completely healed), destroyed his domestic agenda, cost himself a chance at re-election and helped to ensure Nixon's victory in November 1968. Put it all together and you have a President whose foreign policy was one for the ages - and not in a good way."

Mr Biden told reporters after the meeting that the US would continue to raise its concerns over fundamental human rights, and said he issued a warning should Mr Navalny died while being held in a Russian prison.

“I made it clear to him that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia, I’ll go back to the same point.

"Most voters aren’t rigorously ideological. The median American does not judge a policy by how it comports with her abstract theory of the role of government, but rather, by how well it lines up with her personal intuitions about fairness and which social groups the policy seems to benefit. For this reason, many ostensibly “left wing” or even “radical” policy ideas are actually popular with voters in both parties. On occasion, a red-state electorate will spotlight this fact by voting to expand Medicaid, strengthen unions, or raise the minimum wage. More often, though, the breadth of latent support for ambitious progressive reforms is obscured by the outsize influence that well-heeled interest groups and partisan elites have in determining which ideas are taken seriously enough to poll or debate."

"In 1969, President Richard M. Nixon proposed replacing the program with a “Family Assistance Plan.” He was advised by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Harvard University professor and future senator from New York who supervised my research when I was a doctoral student there.

A four-person household with children that had no other income, regardless of the number of parents present, would have received $1,600 a year—worth nearly $12,000 today, after adjusting for inflation—with the amount gradually declining as earnings increased. In addition, families remained eligible for other kinds of benefits, such as Food Stamps and Medicaid.

Although it was the centerpiece of the Nixon administration’s domestic policy, his Family Assistance Plan died after a long and acrimonious battle in Congress."
[133] https://qz.com/2034245/child-tax-credit-can-biden-pull-off-what-nixon-couldnt/
"Today, somewhat ironically, the Biden administration has put forth—and Congress has enacted—a program very similar to the Nixon administration’s Family Assistance Plan.

The chief difference is that the value of the child tax credit will be phased out for families who earn high incomes. That threshold is set at $112,500 for single parents and $150,000 for married couples. In contrast, Nixon’s proposed allowances were mainly intended for poor and working-class families with kids.

When Congress begins considering extending the measure to 2025, as the Biden administration wants, I expect to see the same concerns that derailed the Nixon administration’s similar proposal. Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, his colleague Scott Winship, and other conservatives have already questioned whether more generous benefits for families could reduce incentives for parents to earn a living."

Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them. Congress may pass legislation that might make it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, such as removing funding. Only a sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order by issuing another executive order to that effect."

"Donald Trump last week signed an executive order and took further administrative action that will weaken the healthcare coverage of millions of Americans. The president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win."

“In recent months, Americans have seen the destructive consequences that follow when the government pays people not to work,” Rubio continued. “These new payments will recreate the same problems and cause totally new ones.

"In its simplest form, a universal child allowance with no phase-out simply provides additional income to each family with children in receipt of a benefit. In the conventional static model of labor supply in economics, this corresponds to an income effect. Economic theory predicts that increases in income that do not increase or decrease the marginal return to an extra dollar of earnings will reduce the incentive to work, and empirical work in economics strongly supports this prediction, although the magnitude of the reduction differs across studies."

"The monthly payments the government started sending out to eligible families in July are already saving three million children from falling below the poverty line — and that's just with one payment.

New research from Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy finds that the first child tax credit payment has already contributed to the child poverty rate dropping from 15.8% in June to 11.9% in July, or a decline of 25%.

The authors note that this monthly decline was driven by the first advance child tax credit payment where the credit alone kept about three million children out of poverty. Families getting advance monthly payments are receiving up to $250 a month per child for children between 6 to 17 and up to $300 a month per child for children under 6 years old. Coronavirus relief measures altogether seem to have been effective in reducing child poverty, keeping 6 million children out of poverty in just July."

"President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to judge his progress on this goal in his first 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by making his own assertions on job creation.

During a White House meeting with CEOs on April 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600,000 jobs.

"You see what's going on. You see the numbers," he said. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on.""

"While many presidents have pushed through legislation at the beginning of their first term, historians have found that no modern president has done as much in the first 100 days as Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Roosevelt faced the unique circumstances of entering office during the Great Depression, the likes of which other presidents had not encountered.

As a result, many presidents try to lower expectations about what they can do in their first 100 days. As President John F. Kennedy said at his 1961 inauguration ceremony, “All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.”

One of President Barack Obama’s senior advisers, David Axelrod, called the 100-day benchmark the “journalistic equivalent of a Hallmark holiday” because it attracts a lot of fanfare but has no real significance."

"There we examine possible economic mechanisms that might explain the partisan growth gap, distinguishing, to the extent possible, between factors that might or might not be attributable to superior economic policy. (Often, the line is fuzzy.) We find that government spending associated with the Korean War (which began under a Democrat and ended under a Republican) explains part of the 1.8 percentage point partisan gap, but that the gap remains large (1.4 points) even after excluding the Korean War administrations. We find that oil shocks, productivity shocks, and, depending on the sample, defense spending, foreign economic growth, or a measure of consumer expectations jointly explain as much as 70 per-cent of the partisan gap. Some, maybe all, of these might be considered blends of good policy and good luck. But our empirical analysis does not attribute any of the partisan growth gap to fiscal or monetary policy."

[...]
Yet, though today’s policymakers have a guaranteed place in economic history, they may not come to be seen as heroes. That is because America is running an unpredictable three-pronged economic experiment that features historic levels of fiscal stimulus, a more tolerant attitude at the Fed towards temporary overshoots in inflation, and huge pent-up savings which no one knows if consumers will hoard or spend. This experiment has no parallel since the second world war. The danger for America and the world is that the economy overheats."

Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy — appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks — the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove."

"There is a large body of literature on the justification for the use of coercion in public health and infectious disease in particular.

According to John Stuart Mill, the sole ground for the use of state coercion (and restriction of liberty) is when one individual risks harming others. The most prominent arguments from bioethicists appeal to preventing harm to others. In the case of children, significant risk of harm to the child is also a ground for state protection."

Herd immunity looks different for different viruses. That's because the concept hinges on how easily a particular virus spreads from person to person.

"It's still unclear exactly how many people will need to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19, but experts estimate that it will take at least 70% of the population — with some estimates ranging as high as 90%," says Dr. Drews."

Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use, to detect rare adverse events and implement approaches to limit their occurrence. 

Reported side effects to COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and short-lasting. They include: fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site. The chances of any of these side effects following vaccination differ according to the specific COVID-19 vaccine."

"Many researchers posted messages on Twitter expressing relief that scientific evidence would have a central role in Biden’s plan. They also celebrated the existence of a coordinated national pandemic strategy, after complaining that Trump’s failure to enact one impaired testing, tracing and other responses required to tame the outbreak.

“This marks a pretty radical shift,” says J. Stephen Morrison, director of global health policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, who compares Biden’s strategy to a wartime national mobilization.

The speedy posting of a federal plan bodes well, says Janet Hamilton, the executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, based in Atlanta, Georgia. “We are really pleased to see the release of a national strategy to ensure we have a coordinated path forward,” she says."

More testing and better data

The Biden plan aims to ensure that everyone in the country can be tested regularly for coronavirus infection by increasing the number of testing sites, and by scaling up the production of rapid tests. Helen Chu, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, says more testing will help, but it won’t be enough if the tests don’t reach communities hit hardest by the virus. She says the US government must figure out how to expand home testing for people who can’t get to testing sites because of work, childcare duties or a lack of transportation."

"Republicans often cite distrust of government as a reason to not be vaccinated, the CBS poll found. They worry the vaccines were produced too quickly. And in some communities, so many people have already had the coronavirus that they think they have developed herd immunity and do not need the shots.

Other supporters of Mr. Trump believe Democrats exaggerated the toll of the pandemic to hurt the former president.

That presents a major challenge to a Democratic administration whose success depends on persuading Americans who did not vote for Mr. Biden to trust that the vaccines are safe, effective and necessary.

"Vaccines save lives. They have achieved complete or near-complete eradication of diseases, such as measles and smallpox that were once thought impossible to beat. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 95% effective at preventing Covid-19 illness in people, and the Moderna vaccine, 94% effective. Despite this, a recent nationally representative U.S. study found that people’s self-reported intent of getting a Covid-19 vaccine declined from 74% in early April to 56% in early December 2020. About two in ten Americans are certain they will not change their mind about refusing the vaccine, according to data from the Pew Research Center. These data are alarming, as even the most effective vaccines will not end the pandemic if not enough people take them."

A survey by Ipsos MORI, conducted in October 2020, surveyed 18,000 adults in 15 countries, and found that 27% of adults did not intend to get vaccinated (Boyon, 2020). This raises the question; What causes this vaccine hesitancy?

Findings from the field of behavioural science may help us gain a deeper insight into some of the underlying causes of vaccine hesitancy. Several respondents to the Ipsos MORI survey expressed that they did not want to get vaccinated as they thought the risk of the vaccine to be too high or the risk of getting Covid-19 to be too low."

"Black people account for 15% of all COVID-19 deaths where race is known, while Hispanics represent 19%, whites 61% and Asian Americans 4%. Those figures are close to the groups’ share of the U.S. population — Black people at 12%, Hispanics 18%, whites 60% and Asians 6% — but adjusting for age yields a clearer picture of the unequal burden.

Because Blacks and Hispanics are younger on average than whites, it would stand to reason that they would be less likely to die from a disease that has been brutal to the elderly. But that’s not what is happening.

Instead, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adjusting for population age differences, estimates that Native Americans, Latinos and Blacks are two to three times more likely than white people to die of COVID-19."

"A week and a half ago, the US coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000 — the most in the world, and more than the next three countries combined.

That number has only grown in the days since. And in the face of that crisis, President Donald Trump has a message for the American people: It was China’s fault, and the only reason the US death toll isn’t worse is because of his quick action in banning travel from China.

In fact, there are many reasons the US death toll is so high, including a national response plagued by delays at the federal level, wishful thinking by President Trump, the sidelining of experts, a pointed White House campaign to place the blame for the Trump administration’s shortcomings on others, and time wasted chasing down false hopes based on poor science."

"Since Aug. 14, the day before Kabul fell to the Taliban, global Morning Consult Political Intelligence data shows that sentiment about the United States has worsened outside the margin of error in seven nations. One of the largest hits to the United States’ reputation came among residents of the United Kingdom – a country that contributed mightily to the U.S.-led war effort for the past 20 years and has pushed back on the hasty withdrawal.

According to surveys conducted Aug. 18-24, America’s net favorability rating (the share of adults with a favorable view of the United States minus the share with an unfavorable view) fell 10 percentage points in the United Kingdom since Aug. 8-14 polling – the biggest decline to America’s global reputation in every place surveyed except for China."

"Porter has different advice: abandon the seat. The U.S.-centered system was built at the end of the Second World War, when the U.S. economy was larger than the four next-largest economies combined. Today, by some measures, it is smaller than China’s. The crisis of U.S. supremacy has been in the making for decades, though Porter thinks that it has now reached its culmination. For the United States to hang onto its increasingly untenable position would only leave it “a militarized, overextended empire in a permanent state of alarm,” perpetually threatening the peace it claims to protect. A better course for the obsolescent hegemon, Porter proposes, would be to “decline gracefully.”"

"Yet Biden does not regard himself as an unsentimental realist. As a senator, he passionately advocated intervention to stop the killing in Bosnia. As a candidate, Biden harshly criticized human rights abuses not only in China—an adversary—but in Saudi Arabia, an ally. Though in last week’s speech, he spoke of defending America’s “vital national interests” as a self-evident proposition that puts debate to rest, he also insisted that “human rights will be the center of our foreign policy.”

Protecting vital national interests and defending human rights cannot both occupy “the center” of American policy for the simple reason that they will often come in conflict. For evidence we need look no further than Afghanistan. Is the lesson we have learned, then, that faced with that inevitable tension, Biden will unhesitatingly default to national interest?"

"On Wednesday, turning to the coronavirus pandemic, Biden announced that Americans who had received two vaccine doses would be eligible for a third to combat waning immunity, the highly contagious Delta variant and the threat of widespread vaccine hesitancy. There was another global backlash.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a moratorium on booster jabs until the end of next month, contending that people yet to receive a single dose should take priority. Tom Hart, acting chief executive of the One campaign, told the Associated Press last month: “The idea that a healthy, vaccinated person can get a booster shot before a nurse or grandmother in South Africa can get a single jab is outrageous.”"

"The TRIPS waiver is critical to combating the COVID-19 pandemic around the world. Demand for the vaccine has already surpassed supply, with high-income countries taking a large share of reserved doses. Given that no single vaccine manufacturer could produce enough vaccines to meet the demand of the entire globe, supporters of the waiver ponder the ethics of multinational manufacturers holding exclusive rights to information and technology, preventing other companies from entering the markets that are not being served—primarily in low- and middle-income countries. Sharing vaccine-related information will not only help get the pandemic in check now, but it could also encourage firms to develop the next round of vaccines that will be necessary to address new variants."
