Discussion Name:
All Humans Should Be Vegan.

1. Thesis:
All humans should be vegan.

  1.1. Con:
  Veganism is unhealthy.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Many [1] expert organizations agree that a vegan diet can be as healthy as an omnivorous one (p. 1 [2]).

      1.1.1.1. Con:
      Nutritionists at the University of Oxford have highlighted that scientists do not know enough [3] about the effects of vegan diets to make clear judgements about their healthiness.

      1.1.1.2. Pro:
      The UK National Health Service [4] has said that it is possible to have a balanced diet while being vegan.

        1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
        This British Dietetic Association (the union supporting dietitians, including those working in the NHS) states that veganism is a healthy option [5] for people of all ages.

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      The WHO has warned that meat substitutes can lead to negative health impacts [6], despite many people considering them to be part of a healthy vegan [7] diet.

      1.1.1.4. Con:
      While USDA dietary guidelines state that a healthy nutritional profile can be gained from a vegetarian diet (p. 33 [8]), they do not make the same claim for a vegan diet.

      1.1.1.5. Pro:
      The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [9] (AND) has supported a well-planned vegan diet as nutritionally healthy and adequate since 2009 (p. 1266 [10]).

        1.1.1.5.1. Con:
        While it may back veganism as a healthy option, the AND's lack of diversity among its members and within its research suggests it may not support [11] marginalised communities to follow such a lifestyle.

        1.1.1.5.2. Pro:
        AND's studies indicated that veganism can lead to health benefits for all people, including pregnant people and infants (p. 1970 [12]).

    1.1.2. Pro:
    A vegan diet is not well-suited for vulnerable individuals or people with lifestyles requiring specialised nutrition, who may be unable to remove animal products from their diet.

      1.1.2.1. Pro:
      Many people with common disabilities may find veganism more challenging [13] due to the time, energy, and fine motor skills required to prepare many vegan foods.

        1.1.2.1.1. Con:
        Disabled vegan advocates have argued that special accommodations [14] can be made for disabled people where necessary.

        1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
        The vegan community has ableist [15] elements [16], creating further barriers for people with disabilities to become vegan.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Since a strict vegan diet may not meet the nutritional requirements of children and adolescents (p. 6 [17]), it should not be forced on children until they are old enough to choose it for themselves.

        1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
        Parents forcing their children to be vegan increases the likelihood of their children being bullied at school [18].

        1.1.2.2.2. Con:
        Children are often pressured into eating meat by their parents [19], cultural conditioning, and advertisements (p. 6 [20]).

          1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          Children are often not educated [21] by their parents on the source of their food.

          1.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
          Since babies and young children cannot decide what they eat, all food (including plant-based food) is essentially forced upon them.

        1.1.2.2.3. Con:
        Parents should have the right to raise a child in accordance with their own values. When they are old enough, children can make their own decisions.

          1.1.2.2.3.1. Con:
          If a parent thinks that stealing is acceptable, that does not mean they should be allowed to raise their child to be a thief.

          1.1.2.2.3.2. Pro:
          Parents are entitled [22] to raise their children with specific religious beliefs and associated dietary restrictions. There is no reason why parents should not also be able to raise their children as vegans.

        1.1.2.2.4. Pro:
        Deficiencies common [23] in vegan diets increase the risk of growth and developmental problems [24] in children and babies.

          1.1.2.2.4.1. Pro:
          Unless carefully balanced, a vegan diet can impair [25] brain development in children.

            1.1.2.2.4.1.1. Con:
            Children of vegetarian mothers do not have a higher incidence of brain development issues than the children of omnivores (p. 1 [26]).

          1.1.2.2.4.2. Con:
          Mothers can breastfeed their children for years [27], and breast milk from vegan mothers has comparable nutritional value [28] to that of non-vegans.

            1.1.2.2.4.2.1. Pro:
            Major vegan [29] organisations [30] consider breastfeeding to be vegan.

            1.1.2.2.4.2.2. Con:
            Some vegans do not believe that breastfeeding is vegan [31]. Avoiding breastfeeding is nutritionally sub-optimal, as breastmilk is a complete nutrient source.

              1.1.2.2.4.2.2.1. Con:
              Avoiding consensually sourced human breastmilk is a controversial [32] form of veganism. A more moderate approach could be pursued instead.

      1.1.2.3. Con:
      Vegan diets can be adaptable and suitable for many kinds of complex or specific dietary needs. For example, there is mounting evidence that a plant-based diet can benefit athletes [33] despite their complex nutritional needs [34].

        1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
        Many successful athletes [35] have disproved the common perception that meat optimizes physical performance, including Olympic runner Carl Lewis [36], who claims that his performance was improved by a vegan diet.

        1.1.2.3.2. Con:
        Iron and zinc [37] are two of the most common nutrient deficiencies [38] in athletes' diets, and are nutrients which are largely unavailable [39] in vegan diets.

        1.1.2.3.3. Pro:
        Researchers have revealed [40] that Roman gladiators had a predominately plant-based diet, so as to enhance their performance (p. 1 [41]).

      1.1.2.4. Con:
      It is currently virtually impossible for vegans to entirely avoid animal products. As such, people should be considered vegan if they do as much as possible [42] to remove animal products from their lives, even if they have to use them on occasion.

      1.1.2.5. Pro:
      Some medical conditions and medication that affect nutrition [43] can prevent a person from going vegan.

        1.1.2.5.1. Pro:
        The restrictive nature of a vegan diet may exacerbate eating disorders [44] or trigger those who suffer from them.

          1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro:
          Research in one clinic found that the number of people in treatment for eating disorders who say they follow a vegan diet was four times [45] that of the general population.

          1.1.2.5.1.2. Con:
          The belief that veganism exacerbates eating disorders is a stereotype [46] which is often perpetuated by disorder treatment centers.

          1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro:
          Veganism can be adopted as a way to legitimise continued restrictive eating behaviour (pp. 5-6 [47]).

            1.1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro:
            An informal survey of eating disorder dietitians found that of their vegan clients, 90% [48] started following a vegan diet after they developed an eating disorder.

            1.1.2.5.1.3.2. Pro:
            Attempting to adhere to a strict vegan diet can lead to orthorexia [49], an obsession [50] with eating a "pure" diet.

              1.1.2.5.1.3.2.1. Con:
              A study found no link between orthorexia nervosa [51] and veganism or vegetarianism, instead citing ethical reasons as the motivation behind these diets (p. 1 [52]).

              1.1.2.5.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              Some influencers [53] have encouraged their followers to adopt unhealthy and needlessly restrictive vegan diets.

            1.1.2.5.1.3.3. Con:
            If everyone were vegan, veganism would no longer be seen as restrictive. This would diminish the attractiveness of veganism to people with restrictive eating disorders.

          1.1.2.5.1.4. Con:
          There is no evidence of a direct causal link [54] between veganism and eating disorders.

        1.1.2.5.2. Con:
        Many processed vegan foods are fortified with nutrients [55] typically found in animal products.

          1.1.2.5.2.1. Con:
          Some vegans, like those who follow a raw food vegan diet [56], do not obtain the nutrients fortified in processed vegan foods.

          1.1.2.5.2.2. Con:
          Individuals suffering from ineffective biosynthesis conditions - such as retinol deficiency [57] and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome - cannot utlise [58] the nutrients in fortified vegan products and need to consume some animal products [59] (p. 1 [60]).

          1.1.2.5.2.3. Pro:
          Many vegan foods are fortified with bacteria-derived [61] vitamin B12. B12 in fortified foods has greater bioavailability [62] than that found in animal products.

        1.1.2.5.3. Con:
        There are very few people [63] for whom some version of a vegan diet is not advisable.

        1.1.2.5.4. Pro:
        Some medications [64] and medical conditions [65] can create predispositions for anaemia, which can cause blindness (p. 1 [66]). As vegan diets can be low in iron [67], veganism can be dangerous for people with these conditions.

          1.1.2.5.4.1. Pro:
          Plant sources of iron only contain nonheme forms of iron, while meat sources contain both heme and nonheme. Having both sources makes iron more available [68] for absorption and use in the body.

            1.1.2.5.4.1.1. Pro:
            Vegans and vegetarians should take twice as much iron as meat-eaters to obtain sufficient iron absorption (p. 1 [69]).

            1.1.2.5.4.1.2. Con:
            People with hemochromatosis [70] can benefit greatly from a vegan diet due to plants' less absorbable nonheme iron (p. 66 [71]).

          1.1.2.5.4.2. Con:
          The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has argued that vegans generally have adequate iron intake and do not experience anemia at a higher rate than others (p. 1629S [72]).

        1.1.2.5.5. Pro:
        The most common trigger foods for some medical conditions - such as celiac disease [73], irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (p. 547 [74]), and G6PD [75] deficiency - are often staples of a vegan diet. People who have these conditions may find veganism difficult.

          1.1.2.5.5.1. Pro:
          Finding establishments that can accomodate both vegan and allergen-free [76] diets can be challenging without lengthy planning and research.

          1.1.2.5.5.2. Con:
          People can successfully [77] live with IBS while following a vegan diet.

          1.1.2.5.5.3. Con:
          Although top allergens are also the top vegan protein sources (soy and wheat [78]), most vegan companies offer products made from peas [79] and almonds [80].

        1.1.2.5.6. Pro:
        Many older people already struggle with health complications [81]. Malnutrition, which is more commonly seen [82] in vegan diets, could make these health conditions worse.

          1.1.2.5.6.1. Con:
          Many older people experience heart problems [83], which are often exacerbated by eating large amounts of red or processed meat [84].

          1.1.2.5.6.2. Pro:
          Humans find it harder to synthesize [85] and absorb [86] nutrients as they age. Since vegan foods tend to have a lower bioavailability than animal products, older vegans may not get sufficient nutrition.

    1.1.3. Con:
    Global veganism could help eradicate world hunger, the greatest health crisis [87] facing humankind in the long term (p. 1 [88]).

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      Global veganism would reduce food and health inequality.

        1.1.3.1.1. Con:
        Even if all humans were vegan, it does not follow that the vegan diets of the rich and poor would be equal in quality, variety, or reliability.

        1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
        Some people believe veganism promotes inequality, as it could be considered a sign of privilege [89] because it is difficult to maintain. If everyone were vegan, this perception would no longer exist.

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      Vegan foods can be more readily and cheaply preserved for longer.

        1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
        Most non-preserved fruit and vegetables last longer [90] at room temperature than non-preserved animal products, which quickly spoil.

        1.1.3.2.2. Pro:
        Many vegan foods do not require freezing or canning and have a shelf life of 2 years or longer [91].

        1.1.3.2.3. Con:
        Freezing [92], canning [93], and drying [94] meat increases its shelf life.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Universal veganism would worsen existing food distribution and access problems.

        1.1.3.3.1. Con:
        Food deserts [95] are not doomed to be food deserts forever. As technology changes [96], new solutions may be found to make fresh food more readily available in these areas.

          1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
          Modern urban farming techniques such as hydroponics [97], aquaponics [98], and microfarming [99] could combat food deserts while saving animals from harm.

        1.1.3.3.2. Con:
        Many staple crops can be grown in highly diverse environments [100]. For example, some starch crops [101] can be grown in most climates, which may help combat food deserts.

        1.1.3.3.3. Pro:
        Fresh fruit and vegetables can be very difficult to source in food deserts [102]. It is unclear how this problem would be solved in a vegan society.

        1.1.3.3.4. Pro:
        Food swamps have very high numbers of fast-food restaurants [103]. Even if all humans were vegan, unhealthy eating in food swamps would probably continue, especially as major fast-food brands [104] increasingly offer vegan options.

        1.1.3.3.5. Con:
        Arbitrarily discarded fruit and vegetables, such as the billions of pounds [105] of "ugly" produce, could help feed large numbers of people worldwide.

      1.1.3.4. Con:
      Compared to animal products, vegan foods have low bioavailability [106]. Vegans may be unable to replace the nutrients lost through common diarrheal diseases [107], making veganism an inappropriate diet choice for people in developing countries.

      1.1.3.5. Pro:
      If all humans were vegan, plant crops currently grown for farm animal consumption could feed humans instead.

        1.1.3.5.1. Pro:
        Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based ones in the US could add enough food to feed 350 million additional people (p. 3804 [108]).

        1.1.3.5.2. Con:
        World hunger is not currently caused by a lack of food but by geopolitical inequalities and conflicts (p. 14 [109]).

          1.1.3.5.2.1. Pro:
          Hunger is often a consequence of poverty or war [110]. A vegan society will not change those issues.

            1.1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro:
            Under capitalism [111], where poverty is a major cause of starvation, veganism cannot solve world hunger. Without the promise of profit, farmers will have no incentive to convert livestock crops to those for human consumption.

          1.1.3.5.2.2. Con:
          Hunger has always existed [112], both in times of geopolitical stability and conflict.

        1.1.3.5.3. Pro:
        More than 800 million [113] people worldwide do not have enough to eat. Livestock grain could feed them all [114] if used for human consumption instead.

          1.1.3.5.3.1. Con:
          86% of livestock feed is inedible for humans (p. 1 [115]). Animals are therefore helping humans recycle crop co-products and food waste [116] (p. 10 [117]).

            1.1.3.5.3.1.1. Pro:
            Food grown for humans that does not meet food standards [118] (such as those imposed by the USDA [119]) is usually discarded. A sensible alternative would be to repurpose this discarded food as animal feed.

              1.1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
              Inedible or spoiled plant co-products could be utilised as fertilizers [120] in place of manure or chemicals instead of being consumed by animals.

              1.1.3.5.3.1.1.2. Pro:
              Otherwise unusable by-products from many food industries already become animal feed (p. 2 [121]).

              1.1.3.5.3.1.1.3. Con:
              Feeding livestock low-quality feed grains may result in malnutrition [122].

              1.1.3.5.3.1.1.4. Pro:
              As humans become wealthier, they are less interested in eating low-quality grains (p. 34 [123]). These grains will go to waste if we do not repurpose them for animals.

            1.1.3.5.3.1.2. Con:
            Grain-fed animals [124] eat the same foods as humans.

            1.1.3.5.3.1.3. Pro:
            Many livestock are fed plants that are high in cellulose (such as grass [125]), which humans cannot digest [126].

            1.1.3.5.3.1.4. Con:
            Future technologies may be able to convert previously inedible [127] biological matter into food that is digestible for humans [128].

          1.1.3.5.3.2. Pro:
          On top of grazing land, around 40% [129] of the world's grain is fed to cattle to top up their diets. Therefore, reducing meat production would reduce grain use without reducing the number of calories produced.

          1.1.3.5.3.3. Pro:
          Many crops produced for animal feed are grown in areas with high levels of starvation [130]. If these farmers stopped exporting their crops to feed animals, they could sell their harvest locally.

        1.1.3.5.4. Con:
        Humans already produce more food [131] than they eat. There is no need for societies to become vegan to allow all humans to have enough to eat: a better means of distributing food is needed.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    It is often necessary for a vegan diet to include food supplements [132], as it lacks specific essential nutrients [133] contained in a healthy diet.

      1.1.4.1. Con:
      Research suggests that no significant vitamin or mineral deficiencies affect the vegan population compared to non-vegans (p. 2 [134]). This is largely because most core vitamins can be easily obtained on a vegan diet.

        1.1.4.1.1. Con:
        Some vegan foods contain anti-nutrients [135]. These can prevent people from absorbing nutrients they would typically get from meat.

          1.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
          Anti-nutrients from plant-based foods are not a concern for human health and may actually help lower the absorption of proteins and phosphates (p. 19 [136]), high levels of which can lead to kidney damage [137].

          1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro:
          Excessive consumption of certain legumes can lead to conditions such as the growth of goiters (p. 24 [138]).

        1.1.4.1.2. Pro:
        Vitamin K2 is found in soy-based natto [139], but also, inconsistently, in fermented foods like sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha [140].

        1.1.4.1.3. Pro:
        Many vegan foods have high levels of vitamin C [141] (while animal products do not), which helps with calcium absorption.

        1.1.4.1.4. Pro:
        Despite common claims [142], there are multiple vegan dietary sources of vitamin D (pp. 15-16 [143]).

      1.1.4.2. Pro:
      Iodine is not consistently available [144] from vegan foods.

        1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
        Studies on populations in London and Boston have found that vegans and vegetarians who do not supplement their diets risk considerable iodine deficiency (p. E1303 [145], p. 529 [146]).

        1.1.4.2.2. Con:
        Table salt is iodized in many countries [147] because iodine deficiency is recognized as a public health concern among many people, not just vegans.

        1.1.4.2.3. Pro:
        Because cattle are given iodine supplements [148], and iodine solutions are used to clean the teats of milking cows, dairy can be a good source of iodine.

        1.1.4.2.4. Con:
        High amounts of iodine are naturally present in seaweed [149], which can be cultivated in a variety of coastline environments [150].

      1.1.4.3. Con:
      Some nutrients and vitamins are actually easier to obtain with a vegan diet, compared to a meat-eating one.

        1.1.4.3.1. Con:
        Even if some vegan foods have higher amounts of certain vitamins and nutrients, it may nonetheless be easier to access all the nutrients one needs with an omnivorous diet.

        1.1.4.3.2. Pro:
        Some nutrients, like calcium [151], are just as available in vegan foods as in dairy products, like milk.

        1.1.4.3.3. Pro:
        Plant foods contain, on average, 64 times more [152] antioxidants than meat.

        1.1.4.3.4. Pro:
        Plant-based foods provide more fibre, a nutrient that over 90% of Americans do not consume enough of (p. 1391S [153]).

      1.1.4.4. Pro:
      Vegans are more deficient than meat-eaters in the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA (p. 333 [154]).

        1.1.4.4.1. Pro:
        Omega-3 supplements are usually animal-derived [155] since omega-3 fatty acid is primarily found in fish.

        1.1.4.4.2. Con:
        Omega-3 [156] and DHA [157] are both readily available from a number of vegan food products and supplements.

        1.1.4.4.3. Con:
        EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids could be created from converting plant-based ALA and SDA [158] in the body, albeit at a slow rate [159].

          1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro:
          The omega-3 acids EPA and DHA are found in algae [160], which is how fish consume them. EPA and DHA extracted from algae can be consumed by humans in pill form.

          1.1.4.4.3.2. Con:
          Conversion [161] of the plant-sourced omega-3 (ALA) to animal-sourced omega-3s (EPA and DHA) can be very slow, suggesting that vegans will struggle to obtain enough omega-3 fats.

        1.1.4.4.4. Pro:
        DHA fatty acid deficiencies create significant [162] health risks.

      1.1.4.5. Pro:
      Those following a vegan diet are at an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency [163].

        1.1.4.5.1. Pro:
        B12 deficiency can lead to peripheral neuropathy and anemia if untreated (pp. 65-66 [164]).

        1.1.4.5.2. Con:
        The B12 found in meat is often supplemented [165] into the animal's food [166] rather than being an innate component of it.

        1.1.4.5.3. Con:
        -> See 1.1.2.5.2.3.

        1.1.4.5.4. Con:
        A study detailing individuals with a low normal or deficient B12 range showed that there is no significant difference the between those who eat meat and those who do not (pp. 514-515 [167]).

      1.1.4.6. Con:
      If adequate and correct supplementation can fill in the gaps [168] of a limited or incomplete diet [169], it can be considered complete and healthy (p. 1 [170]).

        1.1.4.6.1. Con:
        Supplements do not replace the need for a varied diet [171].

        1.1.4.6.2. Con:
        The nutrients in supplements may not be absorbed [172] during digestion as effectively as those in whole foods, making them less optimal to fill the gaps left by animal products.

        1.1.4.6.3. Pro:
        Supplements can help to optimise health, even for those who already have [173] well balanced diets. They therefore can be a legitimate, healthy component of a vegan diet.

    1.1.5. Con:
    Veganism can help prevent the emergence and spread of diseases.

      1.1.5.1. Pro:
      A vegan diet may help reduce the risk of certain lifestyle diseases [174].

        1.1.5.1.1. Pro:
        Vegan populations are, on average, less likely to suffer from obesity (p. 1267 [175]), a major risk factor for many diseases and health problems (p. 5 [176]).

          1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro:
          A vegan diet can help prevent heart disease, which is the leading cause [177] of human death worldwide.

            1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro:
            Since it lowers the level dietary cholesterol [178], a vegan diet significantly reduces the risk of ischemic heart disease compared to an omnivorous diet (p. 3640 [179]).

              1.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
              Healthy non-vegan diets can be low in cholesterol [180].

              1.1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
              Many vegan meat alternatives have high amounts of sodium [181], which can increase the risk [182] of heart disease and stroke.

            1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro:
            Replacing dairy fat [183] with the same number of calories from vegetable fat or polyunsaturated fat significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

            1.1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro:
            Veganism aids in the reduction of inflammation [184], which is linked to an increased risk of heart attack.

            1.1.5.1.1.1.4. Con:
            Vegans can still eat some of the unhealthy aspects of an omnivore's diet (such as saturated fat, sugar, and salt). Healthy diets need to reduce all foods that increase the risk of heart disease [185], not just animal-based ones.

          1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro:
          Plant-based diets have been associated with the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes [186] (p. 349 [187]).

          1.1.5.1.1.3. Con:
          Some people gain weight [188] on a vegan diet.

        1.1.5.1.2. Pro:
        Reducing [189] red meat and dairy consumption can decrease the risk of developing dementia.

        1.1.5.1.3. Con:
        Many vegan alternatives are more processed [190] than their meat and dairy counterparts, and tend to contain [191] unhealthy additives that can contribute to lifestyle diseases.

        1.1.5.1.4. Con:
        The research linking animal products to health issues can be contradictory [192].

          1.1.5.1.4.1. Pro:
          While some studies show no apparent difference between the mortality rate of vegans compared to meat eaters (p. 228 [193]), others have found high protein intake from non-plant-based sources to increase individuals' mortality (pp. 1-2 [194]).

          1.1.5.1.4.2. Pro:
          Some studies have linked dairy consumption to a higher risk of osteoporosis [195], while others have argued that limited dairy intake could result in low bone density (p. 1 [196]).

        1.1.5.1.5. Pro:
        The consumption of dairy [197] and red meat [198] has been linked to an increased risk of developing cancer.

          1.1.5.1.5.1. Con:
          The link between dairy and breast cancer has been challenged [199].

          1.1.5.1.5.2. Con:
          Drinking low-fat milk may reduce one's risk of getting colorectal cancer (p. 1330 [200]).

        1.1.5.1.6. Con:
        Dairy consumption may help address [201] malnutrition.

          1.1.5.1.6.1. Con:
          While commercials often suggest that consuming milk [202] is the best way to obtain clacium, many vegan foods contain it much higher quantities [203].

      1.1.5.2. Con:
      The most effective way to prevent communicable diseases in humans is through the practice of good hygiene [204] and food safety education (p. 754 [205]).

      1.1.5.3. Pro:
      Industrial animal farming [206] promotes the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [207].

        1.1.5.3.1. Pro:
        Animals consume 80% of all antibiotics produced, many of which are also used in humans (p. 2409 [208]).

        1.1.5.3.2. Con:
        Some farm chickens are not given any [209] antibiotics.

      1.1.5.4. Pro:
      Many genetically modified crops are designed to be resistant to pesticides, resulting in farmers using them much more liberally [210]. Vegans who consume these crops may be at greater risk of exposure to pesticide residues.

        1.1.5.4.1. Con:
        Only consuming organic crops reduces [211] exposure to pesticides.

          1.1.5.4.1.1. Con:
          It may be difficult or impossible [212] to sustain [213] the world's population on organic crops alone.

        1.1.5.4.2. Pro:
        It is difficult for vegans to avoid consuming pesticides [214], even when they only consume organic produce [215].

      1.1.5.5. Pro:
      The raising and selling of livestock as meat spreads food-borne [216] and zoonotic [217] diseases (such as E. coli [218], toxoplasmosis [219], and swine flu [220]). A vegan society reduces the potential that pathogens will transfer between animals and humans.

        1.1.5.5.1. Con:
        As vegans are increasingly growing their own food [221], they may be at a greater risk of contracting toxoplasmosis from cat faeces in gardens and vegetable plots [222].

        1.1.5.5.2. Pro:
        Because zoonotic disease are near impossible to eradicate, they have caused some of the worst outbreaks [223] in human history.

        1.1.5.5.3. Con:
        Plant-based agriculture can also spread diseases [224].

          1.1.5.5.3.1. Pro:
          Introducing non-native crops to new environments can result in the proliferation of invasive pests and diseases, which may decimate local wildlife [225].

            1.1.5.5.3.1.1. Pro:
            A blight accidentally introduced from Asia in the early 20th century subsequently devastated populations of American chestnut trees [226].

          1.1.5.5.3.2. Con:
          Food-borne illnesses in crops may still come from livestock (pp. 15-16 [227]).

          1.1.5.5.3.3. Con:
          Animal diseases are more likely to pass to humans [228] than diseases in plant crops [229] due to genetic and biochemical similarities.

        1.1.5.5.4. Pro:
        Some of the worst disease outbreaks in human history have been linked to poor conditions in meat markets and factory farms [230]. Universal veganism would reduce the likelihood of these outbreaks.

          1.1.5.5.4.1. Pro:
          The COVID-19 pandemic [231] has been attributed to the sale of live animals in a wet market [232].

          1.1.5.5.4.2. Con:
          Cholera, one of the deadliest diseases in history, is associated with poor human hygiene and sewage disposal [233], not animals.

          1.1.5.5.4.3. Pro:
          The consumption of bushmeat can lead to epidemiological [234] issues, since importing the meat, or the animal it comes from, can bring novel diseases that are difficult to treat in humans.

      1.1.5.6. Con:
      Wildlife may still be a source of food-borne illnesses in vegan food.

        1.1.5.6.1. Con:
        Non-vegans also eat vegan food, so contamination of vegan food would still be a significant problem in a non-vegan society.

        1.1.5.6.2. Pro:
        Food-borne illnesses can emerge from crops that have been contaminated by wild animals. E. coli outbreaks have emerged from contaminated strawberries and spinach [235].

    1.1.6. Pro:
    Many animal products provide a complete protein source [236], whereas most vegan foods do not. As a result, obtaining enough high quality, bioavailable protein through a vegan diet can be challenging.

      1.1.6.1. Con:
      Concerns about protein consumption in developed countries are exaggerated [237]. Most vegans already get plenty of protein in their diets.

        1.1.6.1.1. Con:
        Protein consumption among older people [238] is too low in some countries (p. 1 [239]).

        1.1.6.1.2. Pro:
        Even in developing countries, vegans obtain sufficient quality proteins and amino acids (p. 249 [240]).

      1.1.6.2. Con:
      While many Americans consume sufficient amounts of protein, the processed meat they consume to obtain it is often high in sugar and fat [241]. Getting protein primarily from plant sources may help tackle this issue.

      1.1.6.3. Pro:
      Most foods with the highest protein density [242] are either meat products or derived from animals.

      1.1.6.4. Pro:
      The digestibility of whey [243] protein is 100%, whereas the protein digestibility of black beans is 75% (p. 120 [244]).

      1.1.6.5. Con:
      Some vegan foods, like quinoa, can provide vegans with a complete protein source [245].

      1.1.6.6. Pro:
      Protein-rich vegan foods can contain anti-nutrients like lectins that lower the bioavailability of the protein's amino acids (p. 120 [246]).

        1.1.6.6.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.

        1.1.6.6.2. Con:
        The above study examined the effects of uncooked soybeans, peas, and fava beans on pigs. We cannot assume that the same effect will be present in humans when the foods are cooked (p. 4 [247]).

        1.1.6.6.3. Pro:
        Some doctors [248] have argued that lectins can cause autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes.

  1.2. Con:
  Vegans miss out on enjoyable and culturally important foods and experiences, making veganism a difficult lifestyle to maintain.

    1.2.1. Con:
    Humans primarily eat meat because they are conditioned [249] to do so. Therefore, it is possible to change social norms towards vegan practices.

      1.2.1.1. Pro:
      Research increasingly shows how social influences can change people's eating habits (p. 4 [250]).

      1.2.1.2. Pro:
      Many common historical dishes may be considered unappetising and inedible [251] by most people today. Humans could have a similar attitude towards eating meat [252] in the future.

      1.2.1.3. Con:
      Norms surrounding meat-eating have existed for about 2.6 million years [253]. As such, the conditioning toward meat-eating is highly entrenched and difficult to change.

        1.2.1.3.1. Con:
        Around the world, most of the cultural shift and loss is due to mostly vegan cultures turning to animal products through globalization of carnism, due to the gain of wealth and population [254], as well as climate change (seen with the Brokpa [255]), rather than the other way around. Veganism would actually help us regain the insights that have been lost to us (like why we pickle [256]) for cultural integrity.

          1.2.1.3.1.1. Con:
          The claim that "most of the cultural shift and loss is due to mostly vegan cultures turning to animal products" is completely unfounded, and the Brokpa people which you cited are an outlier as a group that has a population of less than 70k people [257]. Worldwide the population of vegan people has only increased. [258]

      1.2.1.4. Con:
      Mutliple factors play into humans' social conditioning with regards to meat-eating, which makes this behaviour difficult to change (p. 4 [259]).

    1.2.2. Pro:
    Interactions with animals bring people substantial happiness. However, many vegans believe these activities are not vegan and would deprive people of them.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Humans gain many benefits from pet ownership and animal domestication. In a vegan world forbidding pets, these benefits would be lost.

        1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
        Pets and domesticated animals play important roles in human society, acting as police dogs [260], providing mechanical aid [261], and even helping in therapy sessions (p. 1903 [262]).

        1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
        Domestic animals have a positive impact [263] on the physical and mental health of humans and on the emotional development of children (p. 20 [264]).

        1.2.2.1.3. Con:
        Veganism does not necessarily forbid pet ownership. There are many ways that people can keep pets while abiding by vegan principles.

          1.2.2.1.3.1. Pro:
          Most vegans agree [265] that, assuming one treats their pets with respect and dignity, it is morally acceptable to have pets.

          1.2.2.1.3.2. Con:
          Pets do not consent to be owned by a human. Therefore, pet ownership cannot be vegan.

          1.2.2.1.3.3. Con:
          Having pets necessitates holding animals in captivity.

          1.2.2.1.3.4. Pro:
          Vegan diet options [266] are available for some carnivorous pets and domesticated animals.

            1.2.2.1.3.4.1. Con:
            It is not definitively known yet [267] whether vegan diets are safe for pets.

            1.2.2.1.3.4.2. Pro:
            The vegan pet food market has been growing at a significant pace [268], indicating that many vegans are willing to have pets and abide by vegan principles.

            1.2.2.1.3.4.3. Con:
            Some animals, like cats [269], cannot change to a vegan diet.

      1.2.2.2. Pro:
      Zoos can foster sympathy for animals among visitors and help bring animal-related issues to the public's attention (p. 1 [270]).

      1.2.2.3. Con:
      There are other ways of interacting with nature that do not require killing or exploiting animals, like visiting wildlife parks, hiking, or working at animal shelters.

    1.2.3. Con:
    The enjoyment of food [271] is often derived not just from its taste but also from the social aspects of preparing and eating it. People can have comparable experiences on a vegan diet.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      Umami [272] can be found in many plant-based sources, not just meat.

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      Given that the social aspect of eating together is often what makes food culturally important, vegan food would not affect it.

        1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
        Eating in social groups increases the pleasure [273] people gain from the taste of food.

        1.2.3.2.2. Con:
        Often the process of procuring and cooking food [274] is important to cultural food experiences (p. 1 [275]). These would be lost with universal veganism.

          1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro:
          In many seaside cultures, the process of fishing [276] and eating what is caught is an integral tradition.

          1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro:
          Meat substitutes that retain the texture of meat mostly cannot be made locally. Rather, they require a more sophisticated manufacturing process [277]. As such, the ability to make these foods is taken away from communities.

          1.2.3.2.2.3. Con:
          Forms of vegan community cooking are possible and have been widely used [278].

      1.2.3.3. Con:
      Following a restrictive diet can make it harder to engage in social events, as eating in restaurants is more difficult [279].

        1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
        Even when choosing a vegan option in a non-vegan restaurant, there is a risk of cross-contamination [280] from animal products prepared in the same kitchen.

        1.2.3.3.2. Con:
        Difficulty maintaining a vegan diet from a social perspective does not mean that all of humanity should not turn vegan. In fact, it would erase the barrier between meat eaters and vegans as it is now.

        1.2.3.3.3. Con:
        More vegan options are available in most restaurants, and the number of vegan restaurants is increasing [281].

      1.2.3.4. Con:
      Many people prefer the taste of meat and dairy and would miss it were they to become vegan.

        1.2.3.4.1. Pro:
        Meat cravings [282] are common among all people, including vegans.

          1.2.3.4.1.1. Con:
          Vegan substitutes are increasingly realistic, to the point that even professional chefs cannot distinguish [283] them from actual meat. This suggests that such products are likely to satisfy meat cravings in vegans.

          1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro:
          A large proportion of people return to eating meat [284] after trying veganism or vegetarianism.

        1.2.3.4.2. Pro:
        Foods that contained dairy were shown to produce a pleasure surge [285] in humans when compared to those that did not.

        1.2.3.4.3. Con:
        As technology improves, synthetic meat substitutes will be more able to replicate [286] the sensations of meat eating.

          1.2.3.4.3.1. Pro:
          Extensive research is already underway into how technology can improve [287] the realism and taste of meat and dairy analogues.

          1.2.3.4.3.2. Con:
          The diet and lifestyle of an animal have a significant effect [288] on its flavor. This would not be easy to replicate in a laboratory.

        1.2.3.4.4. Con:
        People's taste buds adjust to their diet [289], enabling them to stop craving [290] specific foods after some time away from them.

          1.2.3.4.4.1. Pro:
          Cravings can be linked to memories [291] of certain types of food. People can adjust [292] what they perceive as tasty or satisfying by replacing the memory of a particular animal-based food with an enjoyable vegan substitute.

          1.2.3.4.4.2. Con:
          Taste is not the only thing driving people's desires for specific foods. People can get cravings [293] for meat due to their gut bacteria.

        1.2.3.4.5. Pro:
        Meat has powerful stimulating effects [294] on human sensory pleasure.

        1.2.3.4.6. Con:
        Meat creates toxic metabolites [295] that have a stimulating effect that may cause people to become addicted and feel hungover.

          1.2.3.4.6.1. Pro:
          The fact that many people still choose to eat meat (and other animal products) despite knowing their connection with numerous health problems supports the idea that it is addictive [296].

          1.2.3.4.6.2. Con:
          Metabolites in meat products are often a result of processing or canning (pp. 20-21 [297]). It is not clear whether fresh meat poses the same risk.

    1.2.4. Pro:
    Veganism is incompatible with some religions, cultures, and ideologies.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      Meat and dairy are important to some cultures.

        1.2.4.1.1. Con:
        Non-Western cultures already eat fewer animal products than Western ones.

          1.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
          While non-Western cultures traditionally consume fewer animal products, the global desire to align with Western values means this trend is already changing [298] substantially.

          1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro:
          The highest consumers of meat [299] are Western countries such as Australia, the US, and New Zealand. In contrast, many African and South Asian communities generally consume a diet higher in plant-based [300] foods.

        1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
        If all humans were vegan, many traditional non-vegan dishes would be lost.

          1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro:
          Many of the food and drink traditions recognised by UNESCO's Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage [301] contain meat, dairy, or fish [302].

          1.2.4.1.2.2. Con:
          Climate change will make maintaining many of these traditional diets impossible anyway [303]. Altering these traditions to be more eco-friendly is the best way to preserve them.

          1.2.4.1.2.3. Pro:
          Inuit cultures [304] have sustainably hunted and eaten seals for centuries, largely owing to the lack of vegetation [305] in the Arctic. Universal veganism would end these traditions.

        1.2.4.1.3. Pro:
        Traditional culinary practices [306] have value [307] and ought to be protected.

          1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro:
          Often communities build traditions around the forms of animal agriculture [308] that have historically been used in their areas.

          1.2.4.1.3.2. Con:
          Many cultures may be able to find ways to cook vegan alternatives in the same traditional ways [309], continuing to honor their historical practices.

          1.2.4.1.3.3. Pro:
          Food is a powerful cross-cultural bonding [310] tool that brings comfort and happiness.

            1.2.4.1.3.3.1. Pro:
            Traditional methods of meat cooking, like spit-roasting [311] or types of barbecue, are important and valorized by communities.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      Veganism conflicts with many peoples' politics and ideologies.

        1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
        Veganism contradicts humanism [312].

          1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro:
          Humanism declares humans as the most valuable species, while veganism explicitly condemns that as "speciesism [313]" or "carnism [314]".

            1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Just because the focus of humanism is on human welfare, it does not follow that humans are assumed to be more important than animals.

          1.2.4.2.1.2. Pro:
          Humanism affirms naturalism [315] and embraces humans as a result of evolutionary change and, as such, contradicts veganism with regard to its view on human biology.

          1.2.4.2.1.3. Con:
          Humanism is a rational philosophy driven by compassion [316]. Due to the environmental and health benefits of veganism, becoming vegan is a compassionate thing to do for others and oneself.

          1.2.4.2.1.4. Con:
          Some humanist publications [317] have endorsed veganism.

        1.2.4.2.2. Pro:
        Some men feel that veganism undermines their masculinity [318] and, therefore, may feel embarassed by attempting to reduce their meat consumption (p. 2 [319]).

          1.2.4.2.2.1. Pro:
          Just 24% [320] of vegans are men.

          1.2.4.2.2.2. Pro:
          In western cultures, men often associate meat with strength and power, and hence masculinity (p. 1 [321]).

          1.2.4.2.2.3. Con:
          Some men consider their vegan diet to be an important part of a progressive masculinity that embraces feminist and intersectional veganism [322] (p. 1 [323]).

          1.2.4.2.2.4. Con:
          Some prominent male combat sport combatants, like Nate Diaz [324], are publicly vegan. Combat sports are popular among men [325] and emphasise traditional models of masculinity [326].

        1.2.4.2.3. Con:
        Vegans exist in all political and ideological circles, implying that veganism is compatible with most views.

          1.2.4.2.3.1. Pro:
          Vegan conservatives exist [327] in various countries [328] despite them being less likely [329] to cut out meat than those in other political groups.

          1.2.4.2.3.2. Con:
          The fact that some people within all political circles are vegan does not undercut the importance that meat-eating plays in the political views of many.

        1.2.4.2.4. Con:
        Much of the political resistance towards veganism comes from misrepresentation of vegans through pro-meat lobbies [330] or the media.

          1.2.4.2.4.1. Pro:
          The livestock industry lobbies many powerful governments around the world, as well as international institutions like the UN [331].

          1.2.4.2.4.2. Con:
          Even if it is the case that some of the opposition to veganism is manufactured, given that these political actors have great power, anti-veganism has become a sincere view that should be respected.

          1.2.4.2.4.3. Pro:
          Many prominent anti-vegans frequently use lies and exaggerated rhetoric [332] to present vegans as extreme or authoritarian, evoking fear in their audience.

        1.2.4.2.5. Pro:
        US conservatives are less likely [333] to stop eating meat than the US population as a whole because they consider animals to be a type of property [334].

      1.2.4.3. Con:
      Traditions can and do change over time.

        1.2.4.3.1. Con:
        Forcing people to change their traditions often causes a significant backlash [335], which can make change even harder.

        1.2.4.3.2. Con:
        Meat-related traditions may be especially resistant to change, since many people view them as a part of their identity and attempts to change them as an infringement of their personal choice (p. 7 [336]).

        1.2.4.3.3. Pro:
        Many states have outlawed unethical cultural practices.

          1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro:
          International human rights law [337] has developed to ensure discriminatory traditions are discontinued.

          1.2.4.3.3.2. Pro:
          Certain forms of animal cruelty have been made illegal [338] by most countries.

          1.2.4.3.3.3. Con:
          The outlawing of cultural practices typically only applies to traditions that are universally accepted as unethical. Given that many people still feel comfortable eating meat, it is unlikely it will be outlawed.

        1.2.4.3.4. Pro:
        The current global growth in veganism [339] is an indication that people are willing to make changes to their cultural or ideological views.

          1.2.4.3.4.1. Con:
          There are five times [340] as many ex-vegans as there are vegans. Almost two-thirds of them are not interested in re-adopting veganism.

          1.2.4.3.4.2. Con:
          The demand for meat is increasing [341] around the world.

            1.2.4.3.4.2.1. Pro:
            As people continue to eat more meat, it will be harder for them to convert to veganism.

            1.2.4.3.4.2.2. Con:
            The demand for meat could be tied to the subsidization [342] of meat products, resulting in them being cheaper than plant-based food [343]. This would imply nothing about the popularity of meat.

            1.2.4.3.4.2.3. Con:
            Many countries around the world have already reached peak meat consumption (p. 1 [344]).

          1.2.4.3.4.3. Pro:
          Millennials are increasingly moving away [345] from eating meat, suggesting that more younger people are becoming vegan as they learn about meat's ethical and environmental issues.

          1.2.4.3.4.4. Pro:
          In India, where there are millions of vegans [346], a large portion of society became vegetarian a long time ago (p. 1 [347]).

            1.2.4.3.4.4.1. Con:
            Many Indians are vegetarian for religious reasons [348]. It would be difficult to inspire the commitment needed for universal veganism in the modern secular and multicultural world.

            1.2.4.3.4.4.2. Con:
            India has fewer vegetarians [349] than is commonly believed.

            1.2.4.3.4.4.3. Pro:
            Vegetarian practices in India can be traced back to the third century BC [350].

      1.2.4.4. Con:
      Cultures can preserve their practices without compromising them by making vegan substitutions.

        1.2.4.4.1. Pro:
        Many vegan foods [351] are already extremely popular and culturally significant.

        1.2.4.4.2. Con:
        Many traditions require animal slaughter [352]. These cannot be replicated with vegan alternatives.

        1.2.4.4.3. Pro:
        Traditional dishes can use vegan alternatives. For example, dishes involving minced meat [353] can use meat alternatives.

      1.2.4.5. Pro:
      Veganism conflicts with some people's religious beliefs and practices.

        1.2.4.5.1. Con:
        Hinduism advocates for non-violence [354], which is incompatible with the harms committed by the meat industry [355].

        1.2.4.5.2. Pro:
        The Christian and Jewish God endorses eating certain animals in several Biblical [356] verses [357].

        1.2.4.5.3. Pro:
        Some Islamic festivals, such as Eid al-Adha [358], involve the sacrifice of animals.

        1.2.4.5.4. Con:
        Many passages in the Qur'an stress kindness, mercy, and compassion [359] to animals.

        1.2.4.5.5. Pro:
        In Christianity and Judaism, eating a lamb at Easter or Pesach [360] is an ancient tradition that symbolises the saving power of God.

        1.2.4.5.6. Con:
        Many religions already offer alternatives [361] to contentious items in their ceremonies. Given that this flexibility already exists, vegan substitutions should also be made.

        1.2.4.5.7. Con:
        Some religious practices, such as Jainism, align particularly well with veganism since followers actively avoid killing animals, even in extreme survival situations (p. 1502 [362]).

  1.3. Con:
  A global shift to veganism is not feasible.

    1.3.1. Con:
    Veganism is necessarily flexible [363] and, therefore, feasible for most people and circumstances.

      1.3.1.1. Pro:
      The Vegan Society's definition of veganism is less rigid than people often assume [364], requiring only that vegans remove animal products from their lives "as far as is possible and practicable [365]".

      1.3.1.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.2.5.3.

      1.3.1.3. Con:
      The vegan diet is not listed as one of the top 40 most popular diets [366] when ranked by convenience.

        1.3.1.3.1. Con:
        If everyone were vegan, society would have both an increased production of vegan goods (resulting in more affordable [367] produce) and an infrastructure supporting those who found it inconvenient or difficult to find vegan goods.

        1.3.1.3.2. Pro:
        Being vegan requires a greater amount of nutritional education [368] and is therefore less convenient.

          1.3.1.3.2.1. Con:
          All diets require people to educate themselves [369] about what they eat to ensure they avoid bad nutritional habits. Veganism is no different in that regard.

          1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro:
          Adopting a sustainable vegan diet necessitates reading the ingredient list [370] of everything that is not marked as vegan and researching unfamiliar ingredients. This requires a lot of effort and time.

      1.3.1.4. Con:
      The preconception many people hold [371] that becoming vegan is hard would likely make the process of becoming vegan more difficult for them.

        1.3.1.4.1. Pro:
        Studies have suggested that people find things more difficult when they are told they are difficult beforehand (p. 19 [372]).

        1.3.1.4.2. Pro:
        On large societal issues, it is extremely difficult to change [373] people's minds.

          1.3.1.4.2.1. Con:
          Even if it is hard to change people’s minds, that does not mean people should abandon their ambitions to improve the world.

        1.3.1.4.3. Con:
        The existence of prominant vegan organisations [374] and related social media [375] content - that provide easily accessible material and support - has shifted attitudes around how easy it is become vegan.

    1.3.2. Pro:
    A global shift to veganism is economically unviable.

      1.3.2.1. Pro:
      In a vegan world, global and national markets would struggle with the loss of sales of animal products.

        1.3.2.1.1. Pro:
        Countries would depend more on food imports in a vegan world and thus be more vulnerable to global market volatility.

          1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro:
          Many vegan staples, like quinoa, coconut products, palm oil products, and avocados, are imported from across the globe [376].

          1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
          Many people become vegan for primarily environmental reasons [377]. These people may be more inclined to purchase food grown locally, reducing food imports.

            1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
            Living sustainably and in an environmentally-friendly way is not specific to the vegan lifestyle. Buying more seasonal and local produce is also possible for non-vegans.

          1.3.2.1.1.3. Pro:
          Not every country has favorable cropland [378].

          1.3.2.1.1.4. Con:
          Most soy goes to feed livestock [379], so a vegan world may require fewer soy imports.

        1.3.2.1.2. Pro:
        Some countries rely on meat and fish for their economies (such as Iceland [380], Seychelles [381], and Mauritius [382]). Less demand for their products would harm human development in these regions.

        1.3.2.1.3. Con:
        The transition between a meat-eating world and a vegan one could be made gradually and special attention could be paid to those harmed by the change.

          1.3.2.1.3.1. Con:
          Those who suffer as a result of large-scale economic restructuring are often ignored [383] and do not get the support they need.

          1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro:
          Industries harmed by the transition to green energy intiatives could receive compensation [384] for their losses.

      1.3.2.2. Con:
      As demand for vegan products and industries grow, jobs with varying skill levels will be created [385]. These will increase employment [386] and bolster economies around the world.

        1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
        Many large companies worldwide are already profiting from the production [387] of more vegan-friendly products.

        1.3.2.2.2. Pro:
        The global vegan food industry is expected to consistently grow [388] from 2021 to 2026.

        1.3.2.2.3. Con:
        Training workers in new industries comes at a large cost, the bulk of which is often paid for by the public purse [389].

          1.3.2.2.3.1. Con:
          Some vegan organisations are already offering to help retrain former meat industry employees [390] to create vegan products.

          1.3.2.2.3.2. Pro:
          Governments are often responsible [391] for funding retraining programs.

      1.3.2.3. Con:
      Since veganism reduces the risks associated with many chronic conditions that account for the majority of public healthcare spending (p. 167 [392]), a global switch to a vegan diet could reduce healthcare costs (p. 4147 [393]).

        1.3.2.3.1. Con:
        Veganism is correlated with an increase in mental health issues (p. 622 [394]), which already cost the world US$1 trillion [395] annually.

          1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.2.5.1.

          1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro:
          Vegans have an elevated risk of depression compared to people who follow an omnivorous diet (p. 379 [396]).

          1.3.2.3.1.3. Pro:
          Veganism without vitamin B12 supplementation can harm one's physical and mental health (p. 7 [397]).

          1.3.2.3.1.4. Con:
          Many people do not like the idea of animals being killed, yet continue to eat them, exercising cognitive dissonance to avoid thinking about the source of their meat (p. 1 [398]). Refraining from eating animals would resolve this (p. 289 [399]).

            1.3.2.3.1.4.1. Pro:
            Cognitive dissonance caused by meat-eating can cause people to feel [400] stressed, irritated, and unhappy.

            1.3.2.3.1.4.2. Pro:
            Most people who eat meat do not wish animals harm but rather are indifferent to their suffering [401]

            1.3.2.3.1.4.3. Con:
            Veganism may be hard to follow. Failing to maintain a vegan diet is often judged harshly [402] by others, which may produce feelings worse than the cognitive dissonance required for meat-eating.

          1.3.2.3.1.5. Con:
          Minority groups who share ethical eating habits find purpose and orientation [403], which can help improve their mental health.

        1.3.2.3.2. Pro:
        Red meats [404] are linked to certain types of cancers. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, cancer related treatment in the US cost $80.2 billion [405] in 2015 alone.

          1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro:
          The World Health Organisation deems processed meat to be carcinogenic [406] and labels red meat as a probable carcinogen.

        1.3.2.3.3. Pro:
        Those who do not eat meat tend to make healthier lifestyle choices [407] overall, which decreases their strain on health services.

          1.3.2.3.3.1. Con:
          If vegans live longer, this could cause healthcare costs to rise. (p. 137 [408])

      1.3.2.4. Pro:
      A vegan society would be economically damaging for less privileged communities.

        1.3.2.4.1. Pro:
        A vegan world would result in more poverty for those living in rural areas [409] and nonarable environments (p. 9 [410]), many of whom depend on animal agriculture and products for their livelihoods (p. xx [411]).

          1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro:
          Farmers often use animals to store energy for harsh winters [412] or where the terrain does not allow intensive crop farming.

            1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
            Storing food energy for winters is possible without livestock by using equipment such as granaries [413] to protect crop harvests.

          1.3.2.4.1.2. Con:
          Singapore has one of the highest global population densities, making it difficult to grow food. Even so, the city's inhabitants have found ways to grow crops, especially by using vertical farming [414].

        1.3.2.4.2. Con:
        A balanced vegan diet is generally cheaper [415] than one that includes meat. This means that, in a vegan world, consumers may have more disposable income.

          1.3.2.4.2.1. Con:
          The increased need for supplements [416] on a vegan diet may also increase the cost of living healthily, making the diet less accessible.

          1.3.2.4.2.2. Pro:
          Grains and legumes make up most of a vegan diet's [417] protein and calorie content. These are very inexpensive and are often available in bulk or can even be homegrown [418].

            1.3.2.4.2.2.1. Con:
            In the US, fruits and vegetables are more expensive than meat when considered isocalorically [419] (p. 647 [420]).

            1.3.2.4.2.2.2. Pro:
            Certain homegrown produce costs significantly less per kilo [421] than when bought in a supermarket.

          1.3.2.4.2.3. Con:
          Replacing all non-food animal products with vegan ones would be extremely expensive for consumers.

            1.3.2.4.2.3.1. Con:
            As a result of government subsidies, plant-based products are often more expensive than animal products. If the US$38 billion of subsidies [422] currently allocated to meat went to fruit and vegetables, they would be cheaper.

            1.3.2.4.2.3.2. Pro:
            Many commonly used products - which many people may assume are vegan - are made with, or contain, animal-derived materials [423]. The cost of adapting such products to be fully vegan will inevitably be passed on [424] to the customer.

              1.3.2.4.2.3.2.1. Pro:
              Fresh fruit is often coated for preservation. Since there is no way to tell what kind of coating is used, the only sure way to avoid animal-based [425] waxes is to buy organic produce [426], which usually comes with a premium price tag [427].

              1.3.2.4.2.3.2.2. Pro:
              There are sometimes hidden and unavoidable animal-based materials used within medical science.

                1.3.2.4.2.3.2.2.1. Con:
                While the technology is still in its infancy, it is possible to manipulate the genetics of bacteria to create products like milk [428] and insulin (p. 1 [429]).

                1.3.2.4.2.3.2.2.2. Pro:
                Some animal products, such as keratin, have a wide range of medical applications, which consumers and patients may not realise (p. 612 [430]).

              1.3.2.4.2.3.2.3. Con:
              As technology advances, it is increasingly feasible for many products that people mistakenly assume are vegan [431] to be made vegan without affecting [432] their quality.

            1.3.2.4.2.3.3. Pro:
            Ethical fashion brands [433] - which include vegan fashion - often sell very expensive products.

          1.3.2.4.2.4. Con:
          Experimenting to find the right vegan diet can be expensive [434] for individuals.

            1.3.2.4.2.4.1. Con:
            Diets need not be changed suddenly. Someone who wants to become vegan can gradually incorporate [435] more vegan foods until they find a complete vegan diet they like.

          1.3.2.4.2.5. Pro:
          A study [436] comparing a healthy meat-inclusive diet with a healthy meat-free diet found that the latter saved over US$700 a year.

        1.3.2.4.3. Pro:
        High demand for vegan foods may hike prices for local populations that previously depended on them.

          1.3.2.4.3.1. Pro:
          Increases in demand dramatically raised the price of quinoa in Bolivia and Peru [437].

          1.3.2.4.3.2. Con:
          Better planning for equitable food distribution would prevent demand spikes from harming others. This is, therefore, not a vegan-specific problem.

        1.3.2.4.4. Con:
        Poorer people are more likely to be vegan than richer ones.

          1.3.2.4.4.1. Con:
          Dietary diversity is lowest among poorer populations. Given this, it is important that they are able to eat meat (p. 3911S [438]).

          1.3.2.4.4.2. Pro:
          Most individuals that live in poverty are currently eating a majority vegan diet because it is all they can afford [439].

            1.3.2.4.4.2.1. Pro:
            Around a third [440] of the population of India, a country where the majority [441] live in poverty, are vegetarian. This suggests that veganism can be an affordable diet for societies.

              1.3.2.4.4.2.1.1. Pro:
              In India, the average poor diet in the North is vegan and consists of mostly grain [442], whereas some states in the wealthier South [443] are almost 99% meat-eating [444].

              1.3.2.4.4.2.1.2. Con:
              The extremely poor in India [445] tend to be malnourished on a vegan diet, as the food that is affordable does not give them adequate nutrients to survive.

            1.3.2.4.4.2.2. Con:
            Poverty is also strongly linked [446] to malnutrition, so it does not necessarily follow that veganism is better or more feasible for the world's poorest people.

          1.3.2.4.4.3. Pro:
          Some key vegan foods, like rice and beans, are very cheap [447] compared to meat and are staples for many poorer societies worldwide.

            1.3.2.4.4.3.1. Pro:
            China's demand for meat has increased as it has gotten richer [448]. This trend [449] exists in many other developing countries as well.

        1.3.2.4.5. Pro:
        Transport infrastructure means that creating and distributing foodstuffs such as cereals, fruits, and vegetables can be highly inefficient [450] in many developing countries (p. 5 [451]). Even with the eradication of non-vegan products, many staple vegan foods could therefore remain inaccessible.

    1.3.3. Pro:
    Humans have evolved to be natural omnivores [452]. A global population would likely find it difficult to transition to a vegan lifestyle.

      1.3.3.1. Con:
      As the number of vegans grows, veganism will become easier and more accessible.

        1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
        Many people have tried becoming vegan after seeing popular celebrities [453] doing the same, implying that veganism can be successfully encouraged and normalized.

        1.3.3.1.2. Pro:
        As demand for vegan food increases, prices will likely decrease as more infrastructure is developed to satisfy that demand.

          1.3.3.1.2.1. Con:
          Despite a recent boom [454] in the industry, vegan products can still cost up to 200% [455] more than comparable animal-based products.

          1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro:
          Vegan meat analogues [456] are expected to be cheaper than animal meat within a few years, due to upscaling in manufacturing [457] methods.

        1.3.3.1.3. Con:
        The law of supply and demand [458] states that the higher the demand for a product, the higher the price will become as people challenge each other to get a hold of it.

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      An omnivorous diet is what allowed humans to [459] develop as they did. Forgoing it may impede future development and evolution.

        1.3.3.2.1. Con:
        The human gastrointestinal tract is better suited to a plant-based diet.

          1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro:
          A human's digestive tract is most similar to those of monkeys and apes [460], whose diets consist primarily of plant sources.

            1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
            While they may have a primarily plant-based diet, many monkeys and apes do also eat meat [461].

          1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro:
          Despite evolutionary changes, many humans have difficulties digesting lactose [462], suggesting that we may not be well adapted to consume dairy.

          1.3.3.2.1.3. Con:
          Herbivorous gastrointestinal tracts are either multi-chambered [463] or have a comparatively large cecum [464]. The human digestive system is single-chambered with a small cecum, and thus more closely resembles that of omnivores [465].

        1.3.3.2.2. Con:
        The way the human jaw and teeth have evolved makes them ineffective at cutting through meat. Instead, they are optimised for grinding [466] plant-based material.

          1.3.3.2.2.1. Pro:
          The forward-backward and side-to-side range of motion of the human jaw [467] indicates that we are better suited to herbivorous diets, which require grinding rather than tearing food.

          1.3.3.2.2.2. Con:
          Even if humans did not develop jaws [468] similar to carnivores, this might be because they killed their prey with tools and cooked their meat to make it easier to tear apart.

          1.3.3.2.2.3. Con:
          Human teeth are similar to those of other omnivores [469], proving that humans are biologically designed to eat both meat and plants.

        1.3.3.2.3. Pro:
        Eating and cooking meat allowed humans to evolve the requisite anatomy to facilitate speech and language development (pp. 502-503 [470]).

        1.3.3.2.4. Pro:
        The development of human brains greatly advanced [471] when meat consumption increased due to cooking [472].

          1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro:
          Eating meat caused humans to evolve smaller guts [473] to send energy to the brain faster. Our larger brains now use 20% [474] of our body's total energy intake.

          1.3.3.2.4.2. Con:
          Since meat remains preserve better in fossils than plant remains, it is difficult to know definitively what human ancestors ate (p. 255 [475]).

        1.3.3.2.5. Con:
        Just because human ancestors behaved in a certain way does not mean that doing so today is healthy. For example, modern humans crave sugar because it was scarce in the past [476].

      1.3.3.3. Con:
      Humans are the most adaptable species on the planet [477]. This suggests that adapting the human diet is entirely feasible.

        1.3.3.3.1. Pro:
        Natural selection [478] involves evolution and adaptation [479], and humans will not be able to evolve fast enough in response to climate change. Thus, even though veganism may not be in our nature, humans will be able to adapt to it to survive climate change.

        1.3.3.3.2. Con:
        Memory can be passed down through genes [480], meaning that vegan behaviours could be passed down to future generations.

        1.3.3.3.3. Pro:
        While livestock [481] do not handle droughts well, crops like sesame [482] thrive in them. Humans will be able to adjust their dietary preferences to new crops that can survive in the changing environment.

      1.3.3.4. Con:
      When most humans eat animal products, they do not consider [483] the suffering that was required for their meal. If people had to consider the consequences [484] of their diet, far more would be vegan.

    1.3.4. Con:
    Due to the mass availability of vegan products [485] and the development of meat substitutes, living a vegan life is easier than ever.

      1.3.4.1. Con:
      There is often ambiguity surrounding what constitutes an animal product and what does not.

        1.3.4.1.1. Pro:
        Ambergris, which is used in perfumes, medicines, and spices, is a naturally expelled [486] animal product, yet is still often classified as non-vegan [487].

        1.3.4.1.2. Con:
        While there may be disagreements about fringe products, all vegans agree on several core products [488] that should be avoided. Avoiding these products would still make a huge difference in achieving vegans' goals.

        1.3.4.1.3. Pro:
        It is unclear whether foods like oyster mushrooms [489], oysters [490], and some species of figs [491] should be classed as vegan.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      Plant fibers [492] could replace leather if everyone went vegan.

      1.3.4.3. Pro:
      Vegan cosmetics are growing in popularity [493].

  1.4. Pro:
  Veganism reduces both human and animal suffering.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    A vegan society would cause singificantly less harm to wildlife.

      1.4.1.1. Pro:
      In a vegan world, fewer species would be at risk of extinction.

        1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
        A vegan society could help return some animals, such as horses, to the wild in areas where they are extinct [494].

        1.4.1.1.2. Con:
        Properly managed animal farming can benefit biodiversity.

          1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro:
          Well-managed grazing can have a positive impact on biodiversity [495]. Assuming that a vegan society would ban grazing, some species currently benefiting from it may struggle.

          1.4.1.1.2.2. Con:
          Industrial farming is a major cause [496] of the loss of biodiversity.

          1.4.1.1.2.3. Pro:
          If lost herds are not replaced with ruminant animals, deserts [497] will be created, causing far more environmental damage than animal greenhouse gases.

            1.4.1.1.2.3.1. Con:
            The argument that grazing animals can help fight climate change has been challenged [498] by scientists who argue that any environmental benefits are offset by the volume of greenhouse gases emitted by the livestock.

            1.4.1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
            Properly managed regenerative farming [499] of livestock in environments prone to desertification improves ecological systems and helps sequester carbon.

            1.4.1.1.2.3.3. Con:
            Beef agriculture is the most significant cause of tropical deforestation [500], which accounts for around 10% of global warming emissions.

        1.4.1.1.3. Pro:
        Industrial agriculture can dangerously decrease animal populations [501].

          1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro:
          The fishing industry [502] is especially deleterious to the ocean's biota [503] due to overfishing [504] and the disruption [505] of the natural ecosystem.

          1.4.1.1.3.2. Con:
          Sustainable livestock farming [506] is not contributing to significant decreases in animal populations. Decreasing animal populations is a problem specific to industrial livestock farming.

          1.4.1.1.3.3. Pro:
          Up to 100,000 species [507] go extinct annually, largely due to the environmental effects of animal agriculture [508].

      1.4.1.2. Con:
      If all humans go vegan, entire ecosystems could be disrupted by the overpopulation of livestock if they were released into the wild.

        1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
        Human-introduced species have historically devastated local wildlife populations across the world.

          1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          Formerly domesticated pigs were accidentally introduced to the wild [509] in the US and now cause wide-ranging destruction [510] to indigenous flora and fauna.

          1.4.1.2.1.2. Con:
          Many invasive species [511] have been introduced to new territories on vegan crops.

        1.4.1.2.2. Con:
        It's unlikely that livestock would be released into the wild. The livestock would probably still be slaughtered. However, breeding would likely decrease according to demand, reversing the production growth.

        1.4.1.2.3. Pro:
        Not only would releasing livestock into the wild be unethical in terms of its impact on wildlife, but it would be unethical in terms of the harms it would inflict on livestock, who have not been bred to survive in the wild.

          1.4.1.2.3.1. Con:
          Feral [512] animals are proof that domesticated animals - including livestock [513] - can successfully return to the wild.

          1.4.1.2.3.2. Pro:
          The selective breeding of livestock has led to several health and wellbeing issues that would disadvantage them in the wild (p. 182 [514]).

          1.4.1.2.3.3. Pro:
          Domesticated livestock lack the instincts to defend themselves [515] against predators in the way that wild animals might.

        1.4.1.2.4. Con:
        Effective vegan methods to control animal populations exist.

          1.4.1.2.4.1. Pro:
          Neutering [516] can reduce population sizes without killing any animals.

            1.4.1.2.4.1.1. Con:
            The castration of farm animals is routinely performed surgically and without anaesthesia [517]. Any en-masse neutering for population control would likely be performed in the same way, causing significant suffering.

              1.4.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
              Anaesthesia has been used when neutering wild cats [518]. This suggests it could be used when neutering farm animals, even if it is not currently.

              1.4.1.2.4.1.1.2. Con:
              Inflicting some amount of pain and distress on animals is better than killing them.

              1.4.1.2.4.1.1.3. Pro:
              One of the main reasons livestock are not regularly given anaesthesia is its prohibitive cost (p. 2 [519]). There is no reason to think this cost would be considered acceptable when the animals are wild.

            1.4.1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
            Trap, neuter, and release [520] schemes already exist for some animal populations (such as feral cats). These schemes could be applied to former livestock living in the wild.

          1.4.1.2.4.2. Con:
          Hunting can be a more effective method to control overpopulation [521] and invasive animal species, and can rebalance ecosystems [522]..

            1.4.1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
            By 2009, the wild hog [523] population of Texas had become so high that hunting was the only viable solution to prevent them from destroying farms and, consequently, the livelihood of many people.

            1.4.1.2.4.2.2. Con:
            Many species of wild animals have been and continue to be hunted to extinction or near extinction (p. R551 [524]), including by farmers [525].

          1.4.1.2.4.3. Pro:
          Vector control [526], a vegan method, uses biological [527], cultural, physical, mechanical, and legislative methods to prevent wildlife from becoming a threat (p. 1 [528], pp. 1-2 [529]).

        1.4.1.2.5. Con:
        Natural selection [530] will correct for species' overpopulation [531] eventually.

          1.4.1.2.5.1. Con:
          Natural selection does not guarantee a favorable outcome for native species and may lead to the extinction of many species.

          1.4.1.2.5.2. Pro:
          Grazing animals are selectively bred and maintained by humans. Without human protection, their chances of survival [532] are slim as they would struggle to breed on their own [533].

      1.4.1.3. Pro:
      Animal agriculture severely harms wildlife as farmers tend to kill wildlife in order to protect their livestock (p. 1 [534]).

        1.4.1.3.1. Con:
        Wild pigs are destructive, costing the US an estimated $2.5 billion [535] yearly in damages and control costs. It is therefore appropriate for farmers to kill these animals.

        1.4.1.3.2. Pro:
        In Poland, wild boars [536] are killed for no other purpose than to protect livestock from African Swine Fever.

    1.4.2. Pro:
    The meat industry significantly harms its workers and nearby communities.

      1.4.2.1. Pro:
      Safety standards in the meat industry are poor.

        1.4.2.1.1. Con:
        Worker safety standards [537] differ between countries and can be improved regardless of whether all humans are vegan.

        1.4.2.1.2. Pro:
        Injuries in the meatpacking industry are frequent [538] and under-reported [539].

        1.4.2.1.3. Pro:
        Meat plant workers and inspectors had some of the highest rates [540] of contracting COVID-19 of any industry at the height of the pandemic.

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      People living near slaughterhouses are at a higher risk of suffering from various health problems (p. 7 [541]).

      1.4.2.3. Con:
      The meat industry employs half a million people in the US and has brought employment [542] to previously depressed areas (p. 1 [543]).

      1.4.2.4. Con:
      Many crops are picked by migrant farmers that face sexual, verbal, and physical abuse [544], as well as health problems and low pay (p. 6 [545]).

        1.4.2.4.1. Con:
        If everyone were vegan, global agricultural land usage would decrease by 75% [546]. This would result in far fewer farmers, likely improving working conditions.

        1.4.2.4.2. Con:
        Ethical issues with vegan production chains result from broader exploitative production systems, not veganism itself.

        1.4.2.4.3. Pro:
        The cultivation and production of cashews [547] requires workers to come into contact with harmful toxins, causing significant health problems.

      1.4.2.5. Pro:
      Slaughterhouse employees report [548] that their work severely affects their emotional and mental health, which also often impacts their families and communities.

        1.4.2.5.1. Pro:
        Killing or mistreating [549] animals normalises violence, making humans more likely to harm those close to them (p. 403 [550]).

        1.4.2.5.2. Pro:
        Many slaughterhouse workers report having PTSD [551] as a result of their jobs.

        1.4.2.5.3. Con:
        There are a number of other professions [552] that are seen also as mentally stressful and traumatic [553], yet society does not consider these necessary to eradicate.

    1.4.3. Con:
    Humans have the right to treat animals in such a way as meets their needs. As such, they have few obligations to minimize the suffering of animals.

      1.4.3.1. Con:
      The fact that animals can suffer [554] makes them worthy of moral concern and implies that humans ought to not consume them.

        1.4.3.1.1. Con:
        A being’s ability to suffer does not entitle them to specific protections or rights.

          1.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
          The experience of pain and pleasure is the most important [555] moral consideration there is. Since animals can experience them, it is wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering on them.

          1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          Any decision made regarding human development and action will cause some suffering, either to animals or to humans. Therefore, the metric of suffering is too imprecise to guide our action.

          1.4.3.1.1.3. Pro:
          The ability to physically or psychologically suffer [556] does not mean the victim comprehends their pain.

        1.4.3.1.2. Pro:
        The suffering that animals face is much greater than the relative pleasure humans get from non-vegan lifestyles.

      1.4.3.2. Pro:
      It is natural for humans to subordinate animals for their needs.

        1.4.3.2.1. Pro:
        Humans are just another type of animal. Therefore, we are only as morally obliged not to kill or dominate other species as they are morally obliged not to kill or dominate each other.

          1.4.3.2.1.1. Con:
          Most of the animals killed by humans for food - such as cows, pigs, and chickens - do not usually kill humans or each other.

            1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Most predators are not eaten by their prey. The fact that gazelles do not eat lions is not a reason to stop lions from eating gazelles.

          1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro:
          Given that it is natural for animals to prey on each other, it is similarly natural for humans to prey on animals.

        1.4.3.2.2. Con:
        It is rare [557] for humans to desire to kill animals, and their physiology suggests they are not designed to do so [558].

          1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro:
          Early modern humans evolved instincts to repulse animals for their own safety [559], rather than to kill them.

          1.4.3.2.2.2. Pro:
          Human bodies are largely not able to kill animals on their own, implying it is not natural to do so. Humans often need tools [560] to kill animals, unlike other predators.

            1.4.3.2.2.2.1. Con:
            Many non-human animals use tools [561] to kill their prey.

          1.4.3.2.2.3. Con:
          There is evidence that humans have innate hunting traits [562] and possess a natural hunting instinct.

        1.4.3.2.3. Con:
        The fact that an action is natural [563] does not imply that it is moral.

      1.4.3.3. Pro:
      The fact that humans have greater rational faculties [564] than animals makes them entitled to do what they wish with animals.

        1.4.3.3.1. Pro:
        Since animals do not possess free will [565] to the same extent as humans, they cannot have the same rights (p. 538 [566]).

          1.4.3.3.1.1. Con:
          Infants do not possess the rational faculties of adults, yet are considered to have rights.

          1.4.3.3.1.2. Con:
          A lack of free will may mean that animals do not have positive rights [567], but they could still have negative rights, for which free will is not necessary.

          1.4.3.3.1.3. Pro:
          Animals have less of an ability to develop wider or "second order" desires [568] beyond their instincts or biological impulses.

          1.4.3.3.1.4. Pro:
          Humans are entitled to greater rights than animals because we are more free to pursue a wider variety of goals and desires.

            1.4.3.3.1.4.1. Pro:
            Humans have the ability to use and create larger amounts of specific knowledge and technology [569] and to create rich cultures. Animals do not have these abilities to nearly the same extent.

        1.4.3.3.2. Con:
        From a biological [570] and psychological [571] perspective, the distinction between humans and animals is small.

          1.4.3.3.2.1. Con:
          Complex cognitive differences in how humans think and experience emotions mean that it is natural for us to perceive ourselves as superior [572] to other animals.

            1.4.3.3.2.1.1. Con:
            Many mammals can experience similar mental conditions to humans [573], including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and anxiety disorders.

            1.4.3.3.2.1.2. Pro:
            It is difficult to measure the emotional and general intelligence [574] of animals. While animals react to stimuli, they do so differently [575] than humans.

          1.4.3.3.2.2. Pro:
          A number of animals have passed the mirror test, proving that they can recognise [576] themselves as individuals.

            1.4.3.3.2.2.1. Con:
            The mirror test is a very unreliable [577] test of self-awareness.

          1.4.3.3.2.3. Pro:
          Just like humans, animals desire to live.

            1.4.3.3.2.3.1. Pro:
            Animals struggle against and run away from [578] dangers likely to kill or significantly injure them.

            1.4.3.3.2.3.2. Pro:
            Some research suggests that animals mourn [579] the death of others.

            1.4.3.3.2.3.3. Con:
            An animal's desire to live does not imply its right to live. Under the concept of survival of the fittest [580], everything wants to survive, but only the fittest will.

          1.4.3.3.2.4. Con:
          To be a moral actor, one must be capable of making moral decisions [581]. Animals do not have this ability.

            1.4.3.3.2.4.1. Con:
            Even if morals only apply to human actions, they still constrain what humans are morally allowed to do to animals.

            1.4.3.3.2.4.2. Con:
            It is immoral to do harm to a person who is asleep or in a temporary coma as they are still moral agents. The same applies to animals.

            1.4.3.3.2.4.3. Pro:
            Morality is an evolutionary by-product of human intellect (p. 9015 [582]). Most animals do not have comparative intellect.

      1.4.3.4. Con:
      Animals should be considered to have innate rights [583], which are violated by non-vegan practices. Therefore, eating animals relies on speciesist [584] conceptions of animals.

        1.4.3.4.1. Pro:
        The distinction between human and non-human animals is arbitrary. Similar arguments can and have been [585] made to justify violence between different groups of humans.

        1.4.3.4.2. Pro:
        Humans have worth because we are able to reason and decide whether things are good or bad [586]. Since animals can do this too, they ought to be considered full moral agents with rights (pp. 283-284 [587]).

        1.4.3.4.3. Con:
        Plants have many of the qualities generally used to justify granting rights to humans and animals. By this logic, they too should have individual rights.

          1.4.3.4.3.1. Pro:
          That plants react to damage [588] is evidence that these organisms do not want to die.

            1.4.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
            All living things, even bacteria, respond to stimulus (p. 558 [589]). Yet, not all living things are sentient in a morally relevant sense.

          1.4.3.4.3.2. Con:
          Plants lack the nervous system and pain receptors [590] necessary to experience pain, and its accompanying emotions, in the way that sentient beings do (p. 883 [591]).

            1.4.3.4.3.2.1. Pro:
            Without a central nervous system, there can be no integrated perception or sense of self [592]. A sense of self, as a locus of perception, action, and experience, is required to be a moral subject [593].

            1.4.3.4.3.2.2. Con:
            Experts in the field of plant neurobiology can not agree [594] on whether or not plants possess the equivalent of a brain and nervous system.

          1.4.3.4.3.3. Pro:
          Plants can have memory [595], develop social structures [596], walk [597], eat animals [598], "cry" out [599] in pain and even possess some ability to hear [600].

          1.4.3.4.3.4. Con:
          The consumption of fruit by other organisms is an essential part of many plants' reproduction systems, so eating fruit [601] is compatible with these plants’ rights.

    1.4.4. Con:
    Universal veganism would exploit and kill more animals [602] than it would save.

      1.4.4.1. Pro:
      The agriculture industry uses insects like bees to grow crops (p. 3 [603]). Universal veganism would require the greater exploitation of such insects.

        1.4.4.1.1. Con:
        Bees would pollinate plants regardless [604] of whether they are industrially grown by farmers or exist in the wild. Therefore, the role of pollination in the agriculture industry does not constitute exploitation.

      1.4.4.2. Pro:
      Farmers have historically taken land away from wildlife to farm crops, threatening some species. This is especially true of palm oil [605] cultivation.

        1.4.4.2.1. Con:
        Since a number of prominent vegan [606] organizations [607] have been very critical of palm oil, many vegans avoid using it.

        1.4.4.2.2. Pro:
        Palm oil farmers are destroying the habitats of many wildlife species, especially through deforestation [608], thereby contributing to animal suffering.

      1.4.4.3. Con:
      Methods like indoor or hydroponic farming [609] and cultured meat involve far less animal suffering.

      1.4.4.4. Con:
      Raising animals also requires the production of plants, meaning the same suffering [610] will occur. At least, with veganism, an additional set of animals do not suffer.

      1.4.4.5. Pro:
      Vegan agriculture will not stop its heavy use of pesticides, insecticides, and other animal-killing chemicals, because they make vegan products more viable for consumer markets (p. 2 [611]).

      1.4.4.6. Con:
      The accidental deaths [612] resulting from growing and harvesting plants are morally different from the intentional deaths caused by slaughtering animals.

    1.4.5. Pro:
    Animals raised for human use are often treated cruelly.

      1.4.5.1. Pro:
      Despite having a typical lifespan of 25 years, dairy cows are unnaturally overexerted [613] and usually killed after five years.

        1.4.5.1.1. Pro:
        Dairy cows are often artificially impregnated [614] in order to ensure a continuous supply of milk. This inflicts intense stress and pain on the cow.

      1.4.5.2. Con:
      While it may seem cruel, academic and laboratory research often requires animal testing and experimentation [615] in order to create products that save the lives of humans and animals alike.

        1.4.5.2.1. Con:
        There are an increasing number of alternatives to animal testing (p. 223 [616]). Funding and research into these methods would likely be increased in a vegan society, making them more feasible.

        1.4.5.2.2. Pro:
        Animal testing is a core component of the modern pharmaceutical industry’s drug research process [617], given the high risks that initial testing could have on humans.

      1.4.5.3. Pro:
      Many chickens have been bred to produce more eggs [618] than their bodies can handle.

      1.4.5.4. Pro:
      In the dairy industry, some calves are removed [619] from their mothers at birth or killed [620] if it is too expensive to rear them.

        1.4.5.4.1. Con:
        Long-term studies found no evidence that calves suffer behaviourally or developmentally when separated from their mothers (p. 5550 [621]).

      1.4.5.5. Con:
      It is not in the meat industry's interest to treat animals cruelly, as mistreating cattle results in poorer quality meat (p. 6 [622]).

        1.4.5.5.1. Con:
        Crueler methods of livestock management allow farms to increase the quantity [623] they produce at a lower cost. Even if some consumers resent lower quality, cruel farms will likely be more profitable.

        1.4.5.5.2. Con:
        Many slaughterhouses [624] have been caught flouting animal cruelty laws, resulting in animals experiencing immense suffering before their deaths.

        1.4.5.5.3. Pro:
        Meat producers usually want animals to die quickly to prevent pain-associated chemicals from forming, which may spoil the meat (p. 1 [625]).

          1.4.5.5.3.1. Con:
          Not all forms [626] of cruelty result in inferior quality meat.

          1.4.5.5.3.2. Pro:
          Slaughter areas are designed to keep livestock calm [627] so that adrenaline does not ruin the meat [628].

      1.4.5.6. Con:
      There are more ethical routes [629] to obtain animal products that emphasize animal welfare and dignity.

        1.4.5.6.1. Con:
        Humane farming does not meaningfully reduce the suffering inflicted upon animals.

          1.4.5.6.1.1. Pro:
          Meat derived from living animals can only be consumed by excising it from the animals, which involves slaughter or mutilation, both of which necessitate suffering.

          1.4.5.6.1.2. Pro:
          Halal and kosher slaughter methods may actually be crueler than secular farming methods, as they do not stun [630] the animals before killing them, causing more suffering.

            1.4.5.6.1.2.1. Con:
            The slaughter of animals using kosher or halal rules makes the process as quick and painless [631] as possible (p. 31 [632]).

          1.4.5.6.1.3. Con:
          Hunting, if done ethically, can give animals a more peaceful death than they would have experienced at the hands of a non-human predator (p. 183 [633]).

          1.4.5.6.1.4. Con:
          Organic farming [634] places a strong emphasis on animal welfare and requires that animals are kept healthy and in humane conditions.

          1.4.5.6.1.5. Pro:
          Free-range chickens [635] are kept in overcrowded barns and selectively bred, often leading to severe health issues.

        1.4.5.6.2. Pro:
        Purchasing from small-scale producers of animal products is more ethical than purchasing from industrial farms.

          1.4.5.6.2.1. Con:
          Small-scale meat production would be unable to satisfy global demand for meat.

          1.4.5.6.2.2. Pro:
          Campaigns [636] have been founded to encourage meat-eaters to purchase less (but higher quality) meat from local butchers instead of from supermarkets.

          1.4.5.6.2.3. Pro:
          Some forms of animal rearing are not harmful, such as keeping egg-producing chickens in backyards [637].

          1.4.5.6.2.4. Con:
          While purchasing from small-scale producers may be more ethical, most consumers prioritize the cost and ease [638] of meat over the ethics of its production.

        1.4.5.6.3. Pro:
        Scientific advancements, such as lab-grown meat [639], make it possible for people to eat meat without animal farming and slaughter.

          1.4.5.6.3.1. Pro:
          A surge in investment [640] in lab-grown meat companies indicates that it is seen as a viable meat production alternative to traditional farming practices.

          1.4.5.6.3.2. Con:
          While some products exist, the mass availability of affordable cultured meat is still a long way off [641].

        1.4.5.6.4. Con:
        Ethical farming practices are rarely used [642], meaning most people do not have access to - or cannot afford [643] - ethically produced meat.

          1.4.5.6.4.1. Con:
          Halal meat [644] - seen by Muslims as the only ethical way to kill an animal - is widely practised throughout the world. Therefore, it is feasible to use such methods on a large scale.

          1.4.5.6.4.2. Pro:
          Ethical farming is notoriously hard to implement due to backlash from the industry and consumers who fear rising prices [645].

          1.4.5.6.4.3. Con:
          Many countries have begun mandating that animals be stunned [646] before slaughter, making the process significantly less painful for the animal.

          1.4.5.6.4.4. Pro:
          99% of animals raised for food in the US are raised on factory farms [647].

          1.4.5.6.4.5. Pro:
          The land used for animal agriculture currently takes up over a quarter of the Earth's landmass [648], with organic farming requiring approximately 40% more land [649] than conventional farming. It is doubtful whether enough space could be found for all meat to be ethically produced.

          1.4.5.6.4.6. Con:
          There are many companies that produce certified humane animal products [650].

    1.4.6. Con:
    Many vegan practices and portrayals of veganism are racist. These would become more harmful and widespread if everyone were vegan.

      1.4.6.1. Pro:
      Veganism is typically depicted [651] using white, affluent individuals, despite its non-white roots.

        1.4.6.1.1. Pro:
        The foods most associated with veganism originated in [652] communities of color.

        1.4.6.1.2. Con:
        The lack of representation of people of color is a general problem of these countries [653]. It is not caused by, but rather reflected in, veganism.

        1.4.6.1.3. Con:
        Veganism is primarily a first-world trend [654] and is most popular in Western countries and cities.

        1.4.6.1.4. Pro:
        PETA's campaigns promote normative whiteness (p. 89 [655]). This crowds out more inclusive advocacy for veganism and animal rights.

        1.4.6.1.5. Pro:
        A higher proportion of Black Americans are vegan [656] than any other group of Americans.

      1.4.6.2. Pro:
      Advertisements [657] for veganism have made problematic comparisons between the suffering of animals and the suffering experienced by minority communities.

        1.4.6.2.1. Pro:
        In 2020, PETA released an advertisement [658] in which cartoon animals took the knee and called for the end of speciesism.

        1.4.6.2.2. Pro:
        It is common for pro-vegan media to compare animal use to slavery [659] and genocides [660].

        1.4.6.2.3. Con:
        Comparisons between human and animal suffering effectively challenge the mismatch between our moral considerations of humans and animals.

        1.4.6.2.4. Con:
        In a world where everyone is vegan, there would be no need for advertisements for veganism.

      1.4.6.3. Con:
      Many meat products are guilty of environmental racism [661], whereby industrial livestock production disproportionally pollutes Black, Latinx and Indigenous areas.

      1.4.6.4. Pro:
      Demand for vegan foods often forces people off their native land or raises the prices of foods in other countries [662] to fulfill the Western diet.

      1.4.6.5. Con:
      Many vegan companies, like Beyond Meat [663] and Miyoko's [664], have proactively taken anti-racist stances and tried to increase awareness of structural racism.

      1.4.6.6. Con:
      More widespread veganism would likely lead to more inclusive dietary advice.

        1.4.6.6.1. Pro:
        Current guidelines encouraging people to drink milk [665] often ignore the fact that many ethnic minority groups [666] are lactose intolerant.

        1.4.6.6.2. Pro:
        African Americans are the fastest growing vegan demographic [667], whilst also having the highest rates of food-related lifestyle diseases [668] compared to most other demographics. Veganism may be a part of future dietary guidelines for Black Americans (p. 18 [669]).

        1.4.6.6.3. Con:
        Despite the growing popularity of global veganism, white men [670] continue to represent the majority of subjects in clinical trials and other forms of health research, including dietary research (p. 1 [671]).

  1.5. Pro:
  A vegan society would have environmental advantages.

    1.5.1. Con:
    Livestock farming can benefit the environment.

      1.5.1.1. Con:
      Animal flocks could still be held for their environmental benefits without harming or exploiting them.

        1.5.1.1.1. Pro:
        Non-slaughter sanctuary farms [672] provide an ethical way to incorporate livestock into plant farming without exploiting the animals for food.

        1.5.1.1.2. Con:
        Some vegans consider any kind of human control or ownership of animals to be unethical [673]. Using animal flocks, then, could be considered non-vegan.

      1.5.1.2. Pro:
      Vegetation-rich areas that are unsuitable for crop agriculture can be used for grazing [674], reducing the need for other, environmentally damaging [675] animal feed sources.

        1.5.1.2.1. Con:
        Allowing land unsuitable for agriculture to be returned to wild habitats would have a much greater positive environmental impact [676] than using it for grazing.

        1.5.1.2.2. Pro:
        Grazing livestock on marginal lands makes otherwise inedible biomass [677] edible for humans, maximizing land use.

      1.5.1.3. Con:
      Pasture animals can damage biodiversity.

        1.5.1.3.1. Con:
        Traditional pasturing has benefited some native species [678] and helped to preserve their habitats. Stopping it would destroy a centuries-old equilibrium and endanger those species [679].

        1.5.1.3.2. Con:
        In many instances, livestock grazing is crucial [680] for biodiversity.

        1.5.1.3.3. Pro:
        Livestock grazing in forests [681] can reduce the number of species in those areas.

        1.5.1.3.4. Pro:
        In rangelands [682], grazing animals can trample native plant species and replace wild grazers (p. 20900 [683]).

    1.5.2. Pro:
    A vegan society offers the most sustainable way to manage resources.

      1.5.2.1. Con:
      Producing certain vegan foods requires more water than livestock.

        1.5.2.1.1. Con:
        Only a small amount of vegan foods put significant pressure on water resources. Vegans can consume vegan foods that do not use as much water (p. 1577 [684]).

        1.5.2.1.2. Pro:
        Nuts, such as almonds [685], consume the second largest amount of water [686] of all agricultural products, behind only beef.

        1.5.2.1.3. Con:
        Far more [687] water resources [688] are used for animal agriculture [689] than crop agriculture.

      1.5.2.2. Pro:
      Vegan agriculture requires less land, and treats what land it does use better.

        1.5.2.2.1. Pro:
        Beef requires much more land [690] per gram of protein than common plant-based sources such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils.

        1.5.2.2.2. Pro:
        Since natural environments are often destroyed [691] to make space for pasture, a vegan world would reduce deforestation.

          1.5.2.2.2.1. Con:
          Growing the appropriate caloric amount of vegan crops to supplant meat would require more arable land [692].

            1.5.2.2.2.1.1. Pro:
            Veganism wastes land. The lacto-ovo vegetarian diet has the highest estimated carrying capacity overall (p. 12 [693]).

          1.5.2.2.2.2. Pro:
          Vegan food crops, such as fruit trees [694], provide some of the benefits of forests.

          1.5.2.2.2.3. Con:
          Soya cultivation [695] in Argentina and Brazil has been linked to extensive deforestation.

          1.5.2.2.2.4. Pro:
          Twelve million hectares [696] of forest and wetlands (four times the size of Belgium) are lost annually to farming. The majority of this farming is to support animals or grow their feed directly.

            1.5.2.2.2.4.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.4.1.1.2.3.3.

        1.5.2.2.3. Con:
        The farming techniques needed to increase crop production in a vegan world would damage the environment.

          1.5.2.2.3.1. Con:
          Crop rotation is more sustainable for the environment and results in greater yields (p. 405 [697]). This method could be used to increase vegan crop production.

          1.5.2.2.3.2. Pro:
          Monocrop [698] agriculture, which may be needed to meet the demand for vegan products, has been environmentally detrimental.

            1.5.2.2.3.2.1. Pro:
            Monoculture forestry absorbs far less carbon [699] than multispecies forests do.

            1.5.2.2.3.2.2. Con:
            In a vegan world, since humans would not be producing crop for animal feed, crop production is likely to decrease and - with it - the use of damaging techniques, such as monocropping [700].

          1.5.2.2.3.3. Pro:
          Continuous cropping destroys soil structure and causes erosion, while pasture animals can reduce [701] soil degradation (p. 1 [702], p. 1344 [703]).

            1.5.2.2.3.3.1. Pro:
            Pasture animals can prevent soil degradation as they consistently increase carbon content until sufficient levels are reached, as evidenced by studies conducted in New Zealand [704] and Australia (p. 320 [705]).

            1.5.2.2.3.3.2. Con:
            Soil degradation could be reversed through vegan means, such as biochar [706], compost [707], no-till farming [708], biocyclic humus soil [709], and crop rotation [710].

              1.5.2.2.3.3.2.1. Pro:
              Crop residue [711] and plant waste can be left to improve soil fertility and prevent soil erosion, used to produce compost [712], or converted into biomass energy (p. 1 [713]).

              1.5.2.2.3.3.2.2. Con:
              Biocyclic humus is expensive and opposed by large agricultural companies [714], making its widespread adoption unlikely.

            1.5.2.2.3.3.3. Con:
            Overgrazing [715] can cause soil degradation as well as a host of other environmental issues.

            1.5.2.2.3.3.4. Pro:
            At the current rate of soil depletion, all the world's topsoil may be gone in 60 years [716]. Given the gravity of this situation, any methods [717] to reverse this damage (including using animal waste) should be deployed.

              1.5.2.2.3.3.4.1. Pro:
              Many crops are already decreasing in nutritional value [718], suggesting that food grown in topsoil will not be a nutritious food source in the future. Meat may be the only source to replace many of these nutrients.

      1.5.2.3. Pro:
      Compared to animal agriculture, veganism wastes less food.

        1.5.2.3.1. Con:
        Food wastage would still occur in a vegan society, meaning world hunger may still exist.

          1.5.2.3.1.1. Con:
          The waste of animal produce has a greater detrimental environmental effect [719] than the waste of vegan foods.

          1.5.2.3.1.2. Pro:
          52% of fruit and vegetables are lost before they are consumed, more than any other food group (p. 5 [720]).

        1.5.2.3.2. Pro:
        The conversion of crops into meat is highly inefficient compared to the direct consumption of plant matter (p. 8164 [721]).

          1.5.2.3.2.1. Con:
          Not all arable land in the world is suitable [722] for crop production, and many of the by-products of human food production can only be eaten by ruminants.

            1.5.2.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.3.5.3.1.

            1.5.2.3.2.1.2. Con:
            Arable land that is unsuitable for crop production could be reserved as natural ecosystems [723].

          1.5.2.3.2.2. Pro:
          77% of all agricultural land is used to support livestock, but meat accounts for only 18% of global calorific intake [724]. This is a highly inefficient use of energy.

          1.5.2.3.2.3. Pro:
          Only 10% [725] of the energy stored in biomass is passed from one trophic level [726] to the next. Therefore, if herbivorous animals are eating vegetation before being consumed by humans, humans will only obtain 0.1% of the energy provided from that vegetation.

        1.5.2.3.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.3.5.

      1.5.2.4. Con:
      Increased demand for vegan superfoods has encouraged producers to adopt production methods that are bad for the environment [727].

    1.5.3. Pro:
    A vegan society would be the most effective at combating climate change [728].

      1.5.3.1. Con:
      As industries increasingly transition to sustainable fuel sources [729], the reduction of global emissions may be accomplished by means other than the elimination of the meat industry.

        1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
        By 2100, almost all fossil fuel power generation will be phased out (p. 516 [730]).

        1.5.3.1.2. Con:
        The problem of climate change is urgent [731]. Governments must cut emissions in all areas as quickly as possible to have a realistic chance of limiting it. Therefore, even if green energy is adopted, humans should still go vegan.

      1.5.3.2. Pro:
      Global adherence to a vegan diet would contribute to carbon sequestration [732].

        1.5.3.2.1. Pro:
        Fewer fields to grow crops would result in more forests [733], which increases carbon sequestration (p. 2 [734]).

        1.5.3.2.2. Con:
        Developing more properly-managed [735] grazing spaces for cattle by regenerating grasslands may help capture more carbon [736] than the animals produce.

          1.5.3.2.2.1. Con:
          Carbon sinks will eventually reach their limit (p. 2708 [737]), and grasslands supporting grass-fed cattle only store 20-60% of the greenhouse gases [738] produced by the grazing cattle.

      1.5.3.3. Con:
      Cultivated meat is a more environmentally sustainable [739] method of creating conventional food.

        1.5.3.3.1. Con:
        Research suggests that - without considerable changes to its production methods [740] and infrastructure [741] - cultivated beef would not have a significantly reduced carbon footprint when compared to beef from cattle (p. 8 [742])

        1.5.3.3.2. Pro:
        Cultivated meat is likely to require significantly less water and land [743] than is used in traditional meat production.

      1.5.3.4. Pro:
      Vegan diets are associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a much lower carbon footprint [744] (p. 1 [745]).

        1.5.3.4.1. Con:
        When considered per calorie, vegetarian diets may actually produce more greenhouse gas emissions [746] than those of omnivores.

        1.5.3.4.2. Con:
        The research on veganism's impact on greenhouse gases is inconsistent [747].

        1.5.3.4.3. Pro:
        Animal agriculture is a major contributor [748] to global warming. A global move to a vegan diet could reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions (which make up 37% of human-activity emissions [749]) by two-thirds by 2050 (p. 4146 [750]).

          1.5.3.4.3.1. Pro:
          So-called "low impact" meat [751] is as bad, and sometimes worse, for the environment as standard meat, suggesting sustainable meat is impossible.

          1.5.3.4.3.2. Con:
          A vegan society would be more dependent on imported foods, making transport emissions even worse.

            1.5.3.4.3.2.1. Pro:
            Many vegan foods [752] travel more miles [753] than meat, contributing to a higher overall carbon footprint.

              1.5.3.4.3.2.1.1. Con:
              Most food-related greenhouse gas emissions occur during production, with final transport to retail only contributing 4% of the total emissions (p. 3508 [754]).

            1.5.3.4.3.2.2. Con:
            CO₂ emissions from increased transport would still likely pale in comparison to those [755] produced in animal agriculture.

          1.5.3.4.3.3. Pro:
          Methane from cows and other livestock constitutes 44% [756] of human-produced methane in the atmosphere.

            1.5.3.4.3.3.1. Con:
            Converting livestock methane [757] into biogas [758] could reduce the methane emissions from animal agriculture.

        1.5.3.4.4. Pro:
        Plants grown for food absorb CO₂ [759].

          1.5.3.4.4.1. Pro:
          Kelp and other seaweeds are high protein food stuffs that absorb CO₂ [760] more effectively than trees.

            1.5.3.4.4.1.1. Con:
            Kelp and seaweed, which help absorb greenhouse gases in the ocean, are often farmed using unsustainable methods such as dredging [761].

          1.5.3.4.4.2. Con:
          The net absorption of CO₂ by plants is low enough [762] that it does not contribute much to greenhouse gas reduction.

        1.5.3.4.5. Con:
        Vegan diets are often reliant on highly processed meat and dairy alternatives, meaning that most are no more environmentally beneficial (in terms of their carbon footprint) than an ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet (pp. 6-7 [763]).

    1.5.4. Pro:
    A vegan society would create the least pollution [764].

      1.5.4.1. Con:
      Vegan foods and products often contain - or are packaged in - non-biodegradable materials.

        1.5.4.1.1. Pro:
        Many vegan food alternatives still come in plastic packaging [765], contributing heavily to environmental harm [766].

        1.5.4.1.2. Con:
        Many plastic-free stores are vegan or vegetarian [767].

        1.5.4.1.3. Pro:
        Leather is biodegradable [768] and therefore better for the environment than plastic, which is present in many vegan leather alternatives.

      1.5.4.2. Con:
      If all societies became vegan, the use of chemical fertilizers [769] would dramatically increase due to the loss of animal fertilizer. This switch is not a sustainable or eco-friendly option.

        1.5.4.2.1. Pro:
        Some studies have found manure-based [770] fertilizers to be better than inorganic ones. Reducing livestock numbers may, therefore, make agriculture more difficult and costly.

        1.5.4.2.2. Pro:
        Chemical fertilizers can cause dead zones [771] in the ocean.

        1.5.4.2.3. Pro:
        Manure is sustainable, while fertilizer mining is not [772].

          1.5.4.2.3.1. Con:
          Human faeces [773] is vegan and could be a replacement for animal manure.

        1.5.4.2.4. Con:
        Technological advances, such as fertilizer rationing software [774], can reduce fertilizer use.

        1.5.4.2.5. Con:
        Chemical fertilizers are safer for human health than manure.

          1.5.4.2.5.1. Con:
          Chemical fertilizers may increase people's risk of cancer [775].

          1.5.4.2.5.2. Pro:
          Manure can carry diseases (p. 4 [776]).

          1.5.4.2.5.3. Pro:
          Farmed animal manure can introduce antibiotics into the soil, damaging soil-based microorganisms and potentially resulting in the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (p. 2 [777]).

      1.5.4.3. Pro:
      Some byproducts of meat farming are significant contributors [778] to acid rain and ozone erosion.

      1.5.4.4. Pro:
      Pollution caused by grazing damages [779] river systems.

        1.5.4.4.1. Con:
        Rotational grazing [780] can help reduce damage to river systems without abandoning animal agriculture entirely (p. 2118 [781]).

          1.5.4.4.1.1. Pro:
          Large herbivores are important to ecosystems [782]. As modern and ancient people have hunted many of them to extinction, the presence of cattle may be able to replenish more than just soil health.

        1.5.4.4.2. Pro:
        Many waterways are polluted with farm animal faeces [783], causing the water to contain levels of nitrogen and phosphorus [784] that are unsafe for human consumption (p. vii [785]).

          1.5.4.4.2.1. Con:
          Regenerative animal agriculture [786] can benefit waterways and oceans.

          1.5.4.4.2.2. Pro:
          Livestock pollution of waterways causes toxic algae blooms [787], making the water unfit for human consumption.

    1.5.5. Con:
    People's eating habits are not the most important issue that should be addressed to save the environment.

      1.5.5.1. Pro:
      Travel [788] has a significant negative impact on the environment.

        1.5.5.1.1. Con:
        Livestock produce 14.5% of all CO₂ equivalent greenhouse gases (p. xii [789]), while all transportation produces 14% [790] of all CO₂ equivalent greenhouse gases. Becoming vegan would have an environmental effect similar to stopping all travel.

        1.5.5.1.2. Pro:
        The vegan travel industry is growing [791], suggesting that vegans do not necessarily consider the environmental impact of travel any more so than non-vegans.

        1.5.5.1.3. Pro:
        One return long-haul flight cancels out [792] the environmental benefits of two years of veganism.

        1.5.5.1.4. Con:
        Currently, there are few, if any [793], alternatives to extremely polluting forms of long-distance travel.

      1.5.5.2. Con:
      It is possible to immediately decide to be vegan. Other environmental decisions, such as changing to renewable energy, are not always available in the short term.

      1.5.5.3. Pro:
      Oil and energy companies produce some of the highest levels [794] of pollution and contribute to significant amounts of environmental degradation.

      1.5.5.4. Con:
      Given the severity of the climate emergency, people ought to do as much as possible to limit their carbon footprint. There is, therefore, nothing contradictory in both becoming vegan and fighting against other sources of climate change.

    1.5.6. Con:
    Veganism may cause people to be more complacent [795] about their environmental choices, thereby reducing the likelihood they will make other important environmental decisions.

      1.5.6.1. Pro:
      Pro-social environmental behaviours can result in moral self-licensing [796], where individuals feel they have done enough and stop trying to do more (p. 63 [797]). This is likely to happen with vegans, particularly environmental vegans.

      1.5.6.2. Con:
      People may become environmentally complacent even if they are not vegan.

"A vegan or plant-based diet excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. When people follow it correctly, a vegan diet can be highly nutritious, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and aid weight loss.

Increasing numbers of people are moving toward vegan diets due to health, animal welfare, or environmental concerns. A 2018 Gallup poll reports that about 3% of people in the United States are fully vegan and notes that sales of plant-based foods are rising.

Vegan diets tend to be rich in nutrients and low in saturated fats. Research suggests that the diet can improve heart health, protect against cancer, and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes."
[2] https://www.nutrition.org.uk/media/34ll0zbt/faq_vegan-diets_strengths-and-challenges.pdf
"There is some evidence that dietary patterns that include plenty of plant foods have health benefits. A more plant-based diet is typically higher in fruit and vegetables, wholegrains and dietary fibre while being lower in saturated fat and added sugars. In addition, overconsumption of red and processed meat is associated with colorectal cancer. The evidence specifically for vegan diets and health is limited, although some evidence suggests a reduced risk of some diseases, such as cancer. However, we also know that people who follow plant-based diets are often more health conscious overall and also adopt other healthier lifestyle factors. For instance, they are more likely to be physically active, have healthier weights, consume less alcohol, are less likely to smoke, as well as being more likely to have a higher income. This may explain some of the observed health benefits."

"While some research has shown that vegan diets have positive health effects, such as lower risks of heart disease, diabetes and diverticular disease, our recent study also showed that vegans may have a higher risk of fractures, and vegans and vegetarians combined may have a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

The mixed body of evidence makes it difficult to understand what the overall health impacts of vegan diets are. But why is the evidence so inconclusive?

1. Few studies of vegans

Though the number of vegans worldwide is rising, this group still only makes up a small minority of the world’s population. In order to truly understand the health impacts of vegan diets, we’d need to collect data from a large number of vegans, and monitor them over a long period of time to see if they develop any different diseases compared to meat-eaters."
[4] https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/
"For a healthy vegan diet:

- eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day
- base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates (choose wholegrain where possible)
- have some dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts (choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options)
- eat some beans, pulses and other proteins
- choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat in small amounts
- drink plenty of fluids (the government recommends 6 to 8 cups or glasses a day)

"There are lots of ways to approach veganism and you should use the way that is right for you.

However, some vegan diets are a lot of work, and involve things like lots of time, energy, and fine motor skills. These are things that are not accessible to all people in general, let alone all disabled people. For example, a full-time wheelchair user who lives in a house without an adapted kitchen is not going to find cooking very enjoyable, and can’t easily do many of the things that are ‘so simple,’ like maneuvering heavy pots of beans or massaging kale or whatever.

Disabled people need to budget their resources, not just financially but also energywise. The demands of a vegan diet can be too much, and pressuring people into it isn’t going to make them more receptive."
[14] https://veganfeministnetwork.com/is-veganism-ableist-a-disabled-vegan-perspective/
"Veganism is thus about doing the least harm and the most good. And so if one can not go fully vegan due to their health and/or disability, it becomes a matter of doing what they can. Consider eating less meat. Not an option? Considering drinking a non-dairy “milk” (soy, rice, almond, oats, coconut etc.) instead of buying dairy milk. Or if changing ones diet is not an option, then consider purchasing products for your home and body that are not tested on animals, if not totally vegan. One can choose to buy clothing made from synthetic material instead of animal skins such as leather, fur and suede. If you already own a leather coat, as an example, and can not afford to buy a new synthetic one, then wear the coat but do less harm in other ways. My point being, it’s about doing what you can. It doesn’t matter if this doesn’t “qualify” you to accurately identify as vegan. It’s better to do some good and less harm than nothing at all."
[15] https://veganfeministnetwork.com/is-veganism-ableist-a-disabled-vegan-perspective/
"Every time I delve deeper into the disabled twitter-sphere, without fail I come across tweets from the disability community talking about how ableist vegans are. Vegans calling a disabled person a liar when they state that they can not be vegan due to their disability. Vegans telling disabled folk that if they just ate a healthy whole food vegan diet, they would be “cured”. As if said vegans were actual doctors that specialized in that specific disability, and thus were properly educated regarding any possible treatment options (including medications). As if one size fits all and the vegan diet was a solution for every medical situation. As if by default, disability made a person “broken” and in need of fixing / being cured."

"So I’m sure this is going to be a little inflammatory but I do believe that veganism movement as a whole has a huge ableism problem. I am generalising of course, but this certainly isn’t a rare issue or a case of “a few bad apples”. This is something I’ve heard discussed in online disabled spaces for years now. This week, out of curiosity, I ran a survey for my online disabled friends – those who either are vegan, have tried it or wish to – and asked if they had experienced or witnessed ableism within the mainstream veganism movement or online vegan spaces. Out of 147 people who responded, 85% said yes. Of course, this is anecdotal, but I really think it’s an issue that needs to be acknowledged."

Some babies don't like meat as much as fruits and vegetables, which tend to be sweet. If that's the case, try mixing your baby's favorite fruit or vegetable into pureed, slightly warmed meat to help them adapt to the new flavor.

If your baby won't eat meat at first, you can wait a few weeks and then try again. Babies don't have to eat meat, but it's full of important nutrients and is a great first food."

"Children are surprisingly resilient. They survive in less than ideal circumstances. But what we really want is to encourage optimal growth and development based on the evidence. Relying on only plant-based foods to provide all a baby’s needs is not out of the question, but is less than ideal.

We don’t yet have enough evidence to say how current vegan practices affect babies’ health at a population level. But it’s not hard to find examples of vegan diets being blamed for a variety of child health problems. Research on children in the Netherlands being fed a particularly strict plant-based macrobiotic diet showed they suffered nutrient deficiencies and retarded growth, mainly between the ages of six and 18 months.

"Compared with omnivorous mothers, vegetarian mothers have lower intakes of some nutrients required for neurological development. However, there is a lack of information about the impact of vegetarianism during pregnancy on subsequent cognitive function in children. The aim of this study was to investigate whether vegetarianism during pregnancy is associated with altered maternal nutritional status and with cognitive function in children at six to seven years of age. 

[...]

Vegetarianism in pregnancy was linked to higher maternal educational attainment, longer breastfeeding duration, lower incidence of smoking during pregnancy and a tendency towards higher IQ in the mothers. Concentrations of some nutrients required for neurodevelopment were lower in maternal blood during gestation; however, after controlling for confounders consuming a vegetarian diet during pregnancy was not associated with poorer neurocognitive development of the children in this study."

"Experts agree that there are positive health benefits for both the child and the mother.

Breastfeeding is known to provide protection against infections, diarrhoea and vomiting in babies and it is thought to reduce the risk of obesity and other diseases in later life.

But for how long?

At present, there isn't enough UK evidence to recommend how long breastfeeding should last so the advice, in general, is open-ended.

"Breastfeeding into your baby's second year or beyond alongside other foods is ideal," says the NHS website.

It adds: "You and your baby can carry on enjoying the benefits of breastfeeding for as long as you like.""
[28] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32319307/
"The systematic review has shown that all non-vegetarian, vegetarian and vegan mothers produce breast milk of comparable nutritional value. Several differences are primarily attributed to fatty acids and some micro-components, primarily vitamin B12. Regardless of dietary choices, nourishment and adequate nutrition have a significant impact on human milk composition - on the basis of the current evidence, vegetarian and vegan mothers are capable of producing nutritionally valuable milk for their infants, as far as the appropriate supplementation compensating for breastfeeding mother's nutritional requirements is provided. Dietary choices should not be a permanent exclusion criterion for donor candidates in human milk banks."
[29] https://www.peta.org/living/food/is-breastmilk-vegan/
"Breastmilk is the number one choice for many new moms, including vegan ones. It contains antibodies that protect babies from infection, plays a role in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and can lower a child’s risk of developing asthma and allergies later in life. Many vegan mothers are asked if they plan to breastfeed their babies, with the misunderstanding that vegans eschew even human milk. But whether to breastfeed is a choice that humans get to make, while cows and other animals abused for dairy production don’t.

In addition to the various health and environmental benefits of choosing a vegan diet, many vegans choose not to eat animal products because they firmly believe that animals are not ours to use. Like all mammals, a human mother produces milk for the sole purpose of nourishing her baby. So for vegan moms and their babies, there’s no moral contradiction in breastfeeding."

Jade Sanders and Lamont Thomas fed the boy, who was named Crown Shakur, a diet largely consisting of soy milk and apple juice, the Atlanta court heard.

The child was born in a bathtub in the couple's home and never taken to see a doctor. He was dead when his parents took him to a hospital across the street from their flat on April 25, 2004. He was so emaciated that doctors could count his bones through his skin."

"As an athlete, your physical health is key to an active lifestyle. You depend on strength, skill, and endurance, whether you’re going for the ball or making that final push across the finish line. Being your best takes time, training, and patience, but that’s not all. Like a car, your body won’t run without the right fuel. You must take special care to get enough of the calories, vitamins, and other nutrients that provide energy.

An athlete’s diet is not much different than that of any person striving to be healthy. You need to include choices from each of the healthy food groups. However, athletes may need to eat more or less of certain foods, depending upon:

- The type of sport.
- The amount of training you do.
- The amount of time you spend in training."

"In reality, what we know about gladiators’ diet and physiques suggests a very different physical appearance than the one depicted in classical art and contemporary popular culture. According to archaeological research, their abdominals and pectorals were likely covered in a quivering layer of subcutaneous fat. Why? The evidence suggests gladiators carbo-loaded. They ate a diet high in carbohydrates, such as barley and beans, and low in animal proteins. Their meals looked nothing like the paleo or meat-and-fish centric diets now associated with elite warriors and athletes.

Current knowledge of gladiators’ physiques comes from a group of medical anthropologists at the Medical University of Vienna and a nearly 2,000-year-old gladiator grave located in what is now Ephesus, Turkey. (When its inhabitants were interred, the area was part of the Roman Empire.) The mass grave houses the bones of 67 gladiators and one female slave, thought to be the spouse of one of the men buried there."

"The gladiator cemetery discovered in Ephesus (Turkey) in 1993 dates to the 2nd and 3rd century AD. The aim of this study is to reconstruct diverse diet, social stratification, and migration of the inhabitants of Roman Ephesus and the distinct group of gladiators. Stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotope analysis were applied, and inorganic bone elements (strontium, calcium) were determined. In total, 53 individuals, including 22 gladiators, were analysed. All individuals consumed C3 plants like wheat and barley as staple food. A few individuals show indication of consumption of C4 plants. [...] A probable cause for the depletion of 15N in Ephesus could be the frequent consumption of legumes."

"It’s also complicated because in truth, no one is 100% vegan. When I go to the market to get vegan food, I go to a market that has a whole section dedicated to meat, eggs and dairy. Therefore, I am essentially, though indirectly, financially supporting a business that profits from the animal agriculture industry. When I use a grocery delivery service (as due to my disability, I can not always make it to the store), they bag the groceries in plastic bags which (and I kid you not) contain additives that are derived from animals. My point being, that the system in it’s current state, makes it impossible to do zero harm and thus there is no such thing as the perfect vegan."

"In a perfect world, the rise in veganism comes solely from a place of compassion for animals and a personal responsibility towards sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. But in reality, veganism is also being used as a cover for disordered eating.

When 21-year-old music student Katie Alice Macdonald was an inpatient for anorexia, she wasn’t allowed to follow a vegan diet. But when she became an outpatient, Macdonald used veganism as an excuse to control her eating.

“I think being vegan made it easier for me to not comply in treatment because I stated that I didn’t want to be made to have animal produce, and restoring weight on a plant-based diet can be problematic for some dieticians, so I do think I used it as an excuse,” she says."

"The statistics suggest there may be a correlation between veganism and eating disorders. At Newbridge House, for example, 35 per cent of the young people we treat stated they wanted to follow a vegan, vegetarian or pescatarian diet.

[...]

We considered this difference may reflect the age profile at Newbridge, with higher proportions of younger people following a vegan or vegetarian diet, compared with an all-age population sample. To test this, we undertook a survey with female students at a secondary school, asking pupils of a similar age what their dietary choices were.

Comparing same age group samples, we found Newbridge had four times as many vegans, five times as many pescatarians and double the number of vegetarians compared with the school group."

"“I come across the stereotype about vegans having eating disorders more so among my fellow health-care professionals than I do the public,” said Chicago-based vegan registered dietitian Taylor Wolfram.

That stereotype has long been a barrier to securing treatment for vegans who do have such disorders. Until recently, most eating disorder treatment centers wouldn’t accept vegan clients — especially those who need more intensive inpatient treatment — unless they were willing to start eating animal products. This is a big problem, because when someone who follows a vegan diet is rejected for treatment, it’s an average of two years before they try to seek help again, said Tammy Beasley, vice president of clinical nutrition services for Alsana Eating Disorder Treatment & Eating Recovery Centers."

The finding that none of the

The term ‘orthorexia’ was coined in 1998 and means an obsession with proper or ‘healthful’ eating.

But if doing so gives you anxiety about hanging out with friends (what if there’s nothing I can eat?!) or makes you fear certain foods, it can actually be quite dangerous. Yep, being too healthy can actually be unhealthy.

Orthorexia is an obsession with eating a “pure” diet, which can mean avoiding foods with unhealthy fats, added sugar or salt, genetic modifications, artificial colors, or flavors and preservatives. And it’s becoming increasingly common—in part due to the way #cleaneating is glorified on Instagram."

Her inner health freak ate itself, as it were.

Emotionally drained, physically debilitated and borderline mentally ill after just over a year of this, she was caught by a reader eating a chicken salad in a café.

"Food fortification is not something new and it dates back in history to as far as the 1920s as a way to address nutritional deficiencies across the globe.

Good examples of this are fortified foods with iodine, vitamin A, and iron.

What does fortified mean? Any food becomes ‘fortified’ with the addition of vitamins and minerals that were not originally in the food."
[56] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/raw-vegan-diet#the-diet
"What Is a Raw Vegan Diet?

Raw veganism is a subset of veganism.

Like veganism, it excludes all foods of animal origin.

Then it adds the concept or raw foodism, which dictates that foods should be eaten completely raw or heated at temperatures below 104–118°F (40–48°C).

The idea of eating only raw foods has existed since the middle of the nineteenth century when Presbyterian minister and dietary reformer Sylvester Graham promoted it as a way to avoid illness (1).

A raw vegan diet is generally rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, sprouted grains and legumes. It also tends to be naturally low in processed foods."
[57] https://www.healwithfood.org/vitamin-retinol/genetic-deficiency.php
"These women were also not eating enough foods rich in retinol (preformed vitamin A) which is present in foods of animal origin such as calf's liver, egg yolks, cod liver oil and dairy. With an inability to convert beta-carotene into vitamin A and a low consumption of foods that contain retinol, these women were clearly not getting enough vitamin A.

Younger women with the genetic variation seem to be particularly susceptible to vitamin A deficiency as they typically consume less food that contains retinol. Following a vegetarian, vegan or a low-fat diet will further increase the risk of chronic vitamin A deficiency in these women. The older generations appear to be less at risk as they tend to eat eggs, dairy and other retinol rich foods on a regular basis."
[58] https://www.euphoricvegan.com/2020/04/vitamin-a-vegan-nutrition.html
"Preformed vitamin A comes directly from animal products in the form of retinol or retinyl esters - it's present in foods like liver, eggs and dairy. This type of vitamin A is the most bioactive form in the diet - i.e. in a form that is easily utilised by the body.

Provitamin A comes from plants in a number of forms, known as carotenoids. There are 3 carotenoids that can be converted into retinoids; B-carotene, A-carotene and B-cryptoxanthin. These carotenoids aren't as bioavailable for the body and must undergo a chemical transition (more on this later). They're present in lots of plants; partly responsible for the yellow, orange, red and purple colours we see."

"According to MedlinePlus, an online service launched by the U.S. United States National Library of Medicine, cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance present in all of the body’s cells. It’s needed in order to make steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids, which aid in the digestion of dietary fats and oils. The human body is capable of making all of the cholesterol it needs, but it is also present in animal-based foods, including meat, cheese, and eggs."

"Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the defect in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. This defect leads to the deficiency of cholesterol biosynthesis with accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is a well-known mitochondrial protein. Recently, it has been discovered in the human serum where it is reported to be involved in the HDL-cholesterol intake. Here we report the IF1 presence in the serum of two paediatric SLOS dizygotic twins treated with dietary cholesterol supplementation."
[61] https://www.veganlifemag.com/debunking-myth-vegans-vitamin-b12/
"This type of B12 can be derived from an isolated bacteria source (not as nasty as it sounds), meaning that we’re not missing out – in fact just one portion of some of the recommendations listed in the table provide well above the recommended daily intake.

This is where it gets interesting. In most cases this form of fortified vegan-friendly B12 is not bound to protein, therefore it has a greater bio-availability (increased and easier rate of absorption through the gut lining), unlike animal based versions which rely more on the efficiency of digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid in the stomach to break it down to a smaller component, allowing it to pass into the blood stream."
[62] https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/
"Vitamin B12 is bound to protein in food and must be released before it is absorbed. The process starts in the mouth when food is mixed with saliva. The freed vitamin B12 then binds with haptocorrin, a cobalamin-binding protein in the saliva. More vitamin B12 is released from its food matrix by the activity of hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the stomach, where it then binds to haptocorrin. In the duodenum, digestive enzymes free the vitamin B12 from haptocorrin, and this freed vitamin B12 combines with intrinsic factor, a transport and delivery binding protein secreted by the stomach’s parietal cells. The resulting complex is absorbed in the distal ileum by receptor-mediated endocytosis. If vitamin B12 is added to fortified foods and dietary supplements, it is already in free form and therefore does not require the separation step."

"Many medications may interfere with your body's ability to absorb iron. Not being able to properly absorb iron may lead to anemia. Common symptoms of anemia include fatigue and weakness, which happens because blood cells aren't getting enough oxygen. If you need to use a medication that interferes with iron absorption, you may need to take additional iron supplements or alter your medication's dosage or dosing schedule to prevent anemia. Always talk to your doctor if you are concerned you are not getting enough iron."

If you need to change your tampon or pad after less than 2 hours or you pass clots the size of a quarter or larger, that is heavy bleeding. If you have this type of bleeding, you should see a doctor.

Untreated heavy or prolonged bleeding can stop you from living your life to the fullest. It also can cause anemia. Anemia is a common blood problem that can leave you feeling tired or weak."

"In this case presentation, we present a young vegan patient who developed a CRVO secondary to severe iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) attributable to menstrual losses and limited iron intake. CRVO is a rare complication of IDA.With rising calls for sustainable diets and rising evidence for a plant-based diet, there has been a rise in popularity of such diet forms. While there are ocular benefits from this diet trend, the potential for nutritional deficiencies including iron needs to be monitored especially in susceptible individuals. Iron is essential for retina metabolism and function; however, excess iron contributes to disease states in the eye. Therefore, supplementation needs to be judicious."
[67] https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2017/10/06/ways-to-boost-blood-iron-levels-while-eating-a-vegan-or-vegetarian-diet/
"As the Stanford Blood Center blog explains, there are two types of iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron is found in animal products and is generally easier for the body to absorb. Non-heme iron in found in vegan foods and is not as easily absorbed.

Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to make hemoglobin -- the part of red blood cells that bind and carry oxygen in your blood. As the blog explains, "a vegetarian or vegan diet can make it difficult to keep your iron levels high - but contrary to popular belief, this is because of the type of iron consumed, not simply the amount.""
[68] https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/
"Dietary iron has two main forms: heme and nonheme. Plants and iron-fortified foods contain nonheme iron only, whereas meat, seafood, and poultry contain both heme and nonheme iron. Heme iron, which is formed when iron combines with protoporphyrin IX, contributes about 10% to 15% of total iron intakes in western populations.

[...]

The RDAs for vegetarians are 1.8 times higher than for people who eat meat. This is because heme iron from meat is more bioavailable than nonheme iron from plant-based foods, and meat, poultry, and seafood increase the absorption of nonheme iron"

[70] https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hemochromatosis
"Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. Because humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, excess iron can overload and eventually damage tissues and organs. For this reason, hereditary hemochromatosis is also called an iron overload disorder."

"Most important proposed dietary recommendations are: 1) Choose a varied vegetarian, semi-vegetarian or flexitarian diet. A “veggie-lacto-ovo-poultry-pescetarian” diet seems optimal. Avoid iron enriched foods and iron supplements. 2) Eat many vegetables and fruits, at least 600 g per day. Choose protein rich pulses and legumes (e.g., kidney- and soya beans). Fresh fruits should be eaten between meals. 3) Abstain from red meat from mammals and choose the lean, white meat from poultry. Avoid processed meat, offal and blood containing foods. Eat no more than 200 g meat from poultry per week. Choose fish, eggs, vegetables and protein rich legumes the other days. Eat fish two to four times a week as main course, 350 - 500 g fish per week, of which half should be fat fish."

"Heme iron absorption is substantially higher than non-heme iron from plant foods. However, hemoglobin concentrations and the risk of iron deficiency anemia are similar for vegans compared with omnivores and other vegetarians. Vegans often consume large amounts of vitamin C–rich foods that markedly improve the absorption of the nonheme iron. Serum ferritin concentrations are lower in some vegans, whereas the mean values tend to be similar to the mean values of other vegetarians but lower than the mean value for omnivores. The physiologic significance of low serum ferritin concentrations is uncertain at this time.

Vegans generally have an adequate iron intake and do not experience anemia more frequently than others. Typically, vegans can avoid nutritional problems if appropriate food choices are made. Their health status appears to be at least as good as other vegetarians, such as lactoovovegetarians."

But in my view, from a consumer perspective, the thing that recommends peas most strongly is what it’s not — and it’s not soy.

The consumer told us very early that they wanted to avoid having additional soy in their diet.

Why is that?

People have concerns about different types of ingredients. And there’s different conflicting medical literature about different types of ingredients. So if there’s a controversy or disease or discomfort with a particular ingredient, I don’t want to complicate my product with it. So we looked for another source of protein very early."

"People age 65 and older are much more likely than younger people to suffer a heart attack, to have a stroke, or to develop coronary heart disease (commonly called heart disease) and heart failure. Heart disease is also a major cause of disability, limiting the activity and eroding the quality of life of millions of older people.

Aging can cause changes in the heart and blood vessels. For example, as you get older, your heart can't beat as fast during physical activity or times of stress as it did when you were younger. However, the number of heartbeats per minute (heart rate) at rest does not change significantly with normal aging.

Changes that happen with age may increase a person's risk of heart disease. A major cause of heart disease is the buildup of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries over many years. The good news is there are things you can do to delay, lower, or possibly avoid or reverse your risk."

Currently, 36% of the calories produced by the world’s crops are being used for animal feed, and only 12% of those feed calories ultimately contribute to the human diet (as meat and other animal products). [...] We find that, given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people (more than the projected 2–3 billion people arriving through population growth).

Both raw and cooked meat should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends following the “2-hour rule” for meats and other perishable items. The warmer the room, however, the less time meat should be left out. Bacteria doesn’t need long to spread over a surface and grows best at temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And no, cooking or reheating meat that has been left out for over two hours does not kill the bacteria. Don’t risk food poisoning — keep your meats cooled in the fridge."

Hydroponic farming has strong potential to mitigate the threats these issues pose to our agricultural system. Growing crops in near optimal conditions using controlled environment agriculture (CEA) technology is one of the biggest benefits of hydroponic farming. Crops grown indoors and hydroponically can be grown anywhere on earth at any time of the year, regardless of weather conditions, availability of cultivable land, or soil quality. Hydroponic farming has the potential to provide fresh, local food for areas with extreme droughts and low soil quality, such as in sub-Saharan Africa where access to leafy green vegetables is often limited."

"Aquaponics is a farming method that combines the benefits of aquaculture and hydroponics. A nitrifying bacteria convert the wastes that fish produce. They then serve as an organic nutrient source for the plants. The water passes through a hydroponic plant growing section for filtration then recirculated back in the fish tank for reuse. With a natural ecosystem that recycles water continuously, an aquaponics system uses 90% less water versus traditional farming. Additionally, the system is self-sustaining which requires low maintenance and zero pesticides, fertilizers or herbicides.

Aquaponics systems are sustainable and environment-friendly, as there are no toxic wastes and run-offs from chemicals. Ultimately, aquaponics systems can help urban food growers maximize food yield. This is possible by harvesting both fish for a protein source and fresh plant produce."

The greater availability of high-quality foods and the lower incidence of diarrhea in individual children also reduce its adverse nutritional consequences by permitting rapid catch-up growth during convalescence. In some developing countries, however, 30% or more of the children may be moderately to severely malnourished. In a malnourished child, even a brief episode of diarrhea can seriously affect nutritional status and require prompt attention to prevent further nutritional deterioration and its consequences. Furthermore, the high frequency of diarrhea allows less time for recovery and catch-up growth between episodes."

"Some of the basic causes of hunger are societal, such as: 

Poverty:

When people are in a state of poverty, they lack the resources to cover their basic needs such as food, water, and shelter.

Conflict:

Conflict often uproots people from their homes and land, so food production dwindles or stops completely. Conflict also disrupts economies, so markets become unstable. This leaves people who are already vulnerable more susceptible to malnutrition."

But how can it be that hunger is a persistent problem in wealthy America, even when there’s no coronavirus ravaging the economy? And why wasn’t hunger ever part of the debates or campaign speeches of Joe Biden or Donald Trump?

"Looking back at history, hunger has always existed, and always for the same reasons. Poverty is one of the main causes of hunger. If you are poor, you can’t afford nutritious food. This makes it difficult to work or earn a living and often means that people remain in a poverty trap.

Conflicts disrupt farming and food production. Millions of people are often forced to flee their homes, and then they find themselves deprived of access to sufficient food. The vast majority of hungry people in the world live in countries affected by conflicts. Wars or uprisings can also be a direct consequence of hunger: it’s natural to explode with anger when access to food becomes impossible. Food can therefore be a powerful tool in bringing peace to the world."

Cows, for example, have a very different digestive system than our own, and this allows them to thrive on a menu predominantly made up of grass.

Let’s explore how cows are able to eat grass. The key to this ability lies in the stomach. After we chew and swallow our food, the stomach serves as a holding tank where digestion begins and food starts being separated into individual nutrients. Next, food passes into the small intestine where the breakdown continues and where the body absorbs nutrients. This basic digestive process is also true of cows, but there are a few extra steps along the way."

Ruminants-animals such as cattle, goats, sheep, bison, buffalo, deer, and antelope – regurgitate what they eat as cud and chew it again for further digestion. Ruminant intestines are very similar to human intestines in their form and function. The key to specialized ruminant digestion lies in the rumen. 

[...]

Cellulose has many forms, some of which are more complex and harder to break down than others. Some of the microbes in the rumen, such as Fibrobacter succinogenes, produce cellulase that breaks down the more complex forms of cellulose in straw while others such as Ruminococci produce extracellular cellulase that hydrolyzes the simpler amorphous type of cellulose."

One fourth of all grain produced by third-world countries is now given to livestock, in their own countries and elsewhere. Therefore, on a local basis, animal-based agriculture simply perpetuates hunger, poverty, and other components of the cycle such as illiteracy (as high as 66 percent in some countries) and poor human health."

"One common concern about vegan diets is whether they provide your body with all the vitamins and minerals it needs.

Many claim that a whole-food, plant-based diet easily meets all the daily nutrient requirements.

Some even encourage vegans to avoid all supplements.

Despite being well intended, this type of advice can do more harm than good.

Here are 7 nutrients that you may need to supplement with while on a vegan diet."

"Results: Omnivores had the lowest intake of Mg, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin and folic acid. Vegans reported low intakes of Ca and a marginal consumption of the vitamins D and B12. The highest prevalence for vitamin and mineral deficiencies in each group was as follows: in the omnivorous group, for folic acid (58 %); in the vegetarian group, for vitamin B6 and niacin (58 and 34 %, respectively); and in the vegan group, for Zn (47 %). Despite negligible dietary vitamin B12 intake in the vegan group, deficiency of this particular vitamin was low in all groups thanks to widespread use of supplements. Prevalence of Fe deficiency was comparable across all diet groups.

Conclusions: Despite substantial differences in intake and deficiency between groups, our results indicate that by consuming a well-balanced diet including supplements or fortified products, all three types of diet can potentially fulfill requirements for vitamin and mineral consumption."

"(1) Of the compounds reviewed, there are indications that when given in the diet in what would be considered moderate to high quantities, or when administered in isolation, they may exert effects that would be detrimental or impair the body’s reserves or function in some way. There may be some individuals who are more susceptible to these effects for various reasons.

(2) These compounds are rarely ingested in their isolated format as we know from how these foods are traditionally consumed. Plant-based diets which contain these compounds also contain thousands of other compounds in the food matrix, many of which counteract the potential effects of the ‘anti-nutrients’. Therefore, it remains questionable as to whether these compounds are as potentially harmful as they might seem to be in isolation, as they may act differently when taken in within whole foods that are properly prepared. Cooking and application of heat seems to be essential for the activation of some of these compounds."

"As soy became part of the western diet, reports of thyroid disorders emerged. Several papers from the late 1950s and early 1960s reported cases in which infants fed soy formulas developed goitre. Manufacturers subsequently increased the levels of iodine and reports of goitre in soy-formula-fed infants ceased. However, it has been shown that the thyroxine requirements of hypothyroid infants fed soy formulas are higher than in those not consuming soy, indicating that the increased levels of iodine may not have entirely eliminated the earlier problems.

Recently it has been shown that soy can have profound effects on thyroid function in adults."

Iodine is another essential nutrient for the body. Iodine is crucial to making thyroid hormones, and the recommended intake for an adult is 150 mcg. However, about 38% of the world’s population lack adequate iodine levels.

Iodine is in fish, eggs, and dairy products. Unlike vitamin B12, iodine is naturally available to vegans in seaweed.

Despite some natural sources, getting sufficient iodine can still be challenging for vegans. A 2011 study in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found vegans to be at high risk for iodine deficiency.

Low iodine levels can force the thyroid to absorb iodine from the blood, which may lead to hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy or in young children may also impair cognitive development and increase the risk of intellectual disabilities."

However, the amount of iodine in dairy products varies by whether the cows received iodine feed supplements and whether iodophor sanitizing agents were used to clean the cows and milk-processing equipment. For example, an analysis of 44 samples of nonfat milk found a range of 38 to 159 mcg per cup (with an average of 85 mcg/cup used for Table 2).

[151] https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/calcium/
"The amount that is actually absorbed and used by the body is called “calcium bioavailablity.” Some foods have higher calcium bioavailability than others.

For example, dairy foods have a bioavailablity of about 30% absorption so if a food label on milk lists 300 mg of calcium per cup, about 100 mg will be absorbed and used by the body. Plant foods like leafy greens contain less calcium overall but have a higher bioavailability than dairy. For example, bok choy contains about 160 mg of calcium per 1 cup cooked but has a higher bioavailability of 50%, so about 80 mg is absorbed. Therefore, eating 1 cup of cooked bok choy has almost as much bioavailable calcium as 1 cup of milk. Calcium-fortified orange juice and calcium-set tofu have a similar total amount of calcium and bioavailability as milk, while almonds have slightly lower total calcium and bioavailability of about 20%. This may be useful information for those who cannot eat dairy foods or who follow a vegan diet."

"In conclusion, in the present study of 659 British men, the proportions of plasma EPA and DHA were markedly lower in vegetarians and particularly in vegans than in meat-eaters. The proportions of these fatty acids were not affected by the durationof time since the subjects became vegetarian or vegan, which suggests that when animal foods are excluded from the diet, the endogenous production of EPA and DHA results in low but stable plasma concentrations of these fatty acids."

"being vegan or vegetarian: in vegetarians, ALA supplementation increases the concentration of EPA, but not DHA. However, in vegans, the evidence is different. In an interesting study, it was found that although DHA intake by vegans was zero, they still had DHA present in blood phospholipids, even if lower than in fish-eaters. Furthermore, they found that the rate of conversion of ALA into DHA was twice as high in vegans than in fish-eaters. This suggests that this conversion is much higher in the absence of dietary DHA and that our body has an amazing capacity to adapt to its needs. Indeed, vegetarian and vegan diets have been associated with lower but stable plasma phospholipid DHA fatty acid concentrations."
[159] http://www.dhaomega3.org/Overview/Conversion-Efficiency-of-ALA-to-DHA-in-Humans
"The pioneering rodent studies, reported by Lamptey and Walker in 1976 and subsequently supported in numerous subsequent experimental studies, showed that omega-3 deprivation impaired the learning ability of young animals and that rats could convert ALA into DHA for assimilation into brain tissue (membrane phospholipid components). These rodent-based studies had a significant influence on official recommendations from Health and Welfare Canada (1990) and the Food and Nutrition Board (2002) wherein dietary ALA and not DHA, the brain/retina omega-3 fatty acid for structure-functioning, was recognized as the only essential dietary fatty acid. Official recommended minimal intakes were established for ALA for all members of the population (young and old alike). However, extensive controlled studies in human subjects have now all consistently confirmed the very limited metabolic conversion of dietary ALA into DHA, the final end product of the sequential pathway."
[160] https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/
"ALA is present in plant oils, such as flaxseed, soybean, and canola oils. DHA and EPA are present in fish, fish oils, and krill oils, but they are originally synthesized by microalgae, not by the fish. When fish consume phytoplankton that consumed microalgae, they accumulate the omega-3s in their tissues."
[161] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-deficiency#How-to-improve-omega-3-status
"Some foods, such as chia seeds and other plant foods, contain the omega-3 fat ALA. Fish and other foods that are mostly animal-based contain DHA and EPA.

ALA is a precursor to DHA and EPA, which means your body can convert some of it into these two omega-3 fatty acids. However, the conversion rate is very low.

Thus, it’s best to focus on getting enough EPA and DHA directly from your diet or supplements, rather than by consuming ALA.

Fatty fish are the best food sources of EPA and DHA. These include salmon, herring, trout, mackerel, sea bass, and sardines."
[162] https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/
"Omega-3s play important roles in the body as components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes. DHA, in particular, is especially high in the retina, brain, and sperm. In addition to their structural role in cell membranes, omega-3s (along with omega-6s) provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fatty acids from which they are derived; they have wide-ranging functions in the body’s cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems."

[165] http://www.theglowingfridge.com/vitamin-b12-not-just-vegans/
"While B12 can be found in animal foods, it is not synthesized by plants or animals. The bacteria are what make biologically active vitamin B12. Animal tissues store bacteria-synthesized B12 which is passed on to people who eat meat. I touched on this in my Vegan Starter Guide but animals eat grass or whatever they graze on and end up getting their B12 needs met through the soil, that is, if they are lucky enough to eat grass grown in nutrient-rich soil. Conventional factory farm animals are not that lucky, so farmers often give the animals B12 shots…. then humans consume animals, therefore getting B12 through animal foods."
[166] https://baltimorepostexaminer.com/carnivores-need-vitamin-b12-supplements/2013/10/30
"Cattle and other grass-eating animals get B12 and B12 producing bacteria from clumps of dirt around the grass roots that they pull up. Chickens and other birds get B12 from pecking around for worms and other insects. These animals store B12 mostly in their livers and muscles and some B12 pass into milk and eggs.

But, cattle no longer feed on grass and chickens do not peck in the dirt on factory farms. Even if they did, pesticides often kill B12 producing bacteria and insects in soil. Heavy antibiotic use kills B12 producing bacteria in the guts of farm animals. In order to maintain meat a source of B12 the meat industry now adds it to animal feed, 90% of B12 supplements produced in the world are fed to livestock. Even if you only eat grass-fed organic meat you may not be able to absorb the B12 attached to animal protein. It may be more efficient to just skip the animals and get B12 directly from supplements."

"Thirty-nine percent of subjects had plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations < 258 pmol/L, 17% had concentrations < 185 pmol/L, and 9% had concentrations < 148 pmol/L, with little difference between age groups.

The new WHO recommendations aim to help preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics that are important for human medicine by reducing their unnecessary use in animals. In some countries, approximately 80% of total consumption of medically important antibiotics is in the animal sector, largely for growth promotion in healthy animals.

Over-use and misuse of antibiotics in animals and humans is contributing to the rising threat of antibiotic resistance. Some types of bacteria that cause serious infections in humans have already developed resistance to most or all of the available treatments, and there are very few promising options in the research pipeline."

Antibiotics are administered to animals in feed to marginally improve growth rates and to prevent infections, a practice projected to increase dramatically worldwide over the next 15 years. There is growing evidence that antibiotic resistance in humans is promoted by the widespread use of nontherapeutic antibiotics in animals. Resistant bacteria are transmitted to humans through direct contact with animals, by exposure to animal manure, through consumption of undercooked meat, and through contact with uncooked meat or surfaces meat has touched."

Kittens and cats can shed millions of oocysts in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. A Toxoplasma-infected cat that is shedding the parasite in its feces contaminates the litter box. If the cat is allowed outside, it can contaminate the soil or water in the environment as well."

The Salinas Valley in California is a major leafy greens-producing region in the country. Most of the outbreaks listed in the available literature occurred during July to November. Results of the presented system model indicate that the seasonality of E. coli O157:H7-associated outbreaks was in good agreement with the prevalence of this pathogen in cattle and wild pig feces. The current system model also suggested that the probability of the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in the harvested crop was higher during July to November. On the basis of a comparison between the results of different scenarios, it can be recommended that the concentration of E. coli O157:H7 in leafy greens can be reduced significantly if the contamination of soil with wild pig and cattle feces is mitigated."

Before we invented agriculture and domesticated animals, wildlife was a key source of nutrition (and still is in some parts of the world). Without such hunting, we would never have become the planet’s dominant species.

But the equation has changed. There are now too many of us and too few of them.

"Maintaining independence, quality of life, and health is crucial for elderly adults. One of the major threats to living independently is the loss of muscle mass, strength, and function that progressively occurs with aging, known as sarcopenia. Several studies have identified protein (especially the essential amino acids) as a key nutrient for muscle health in elderly adults. Elderly adults are less responsive to the anabolic stimulus of low doses of amino acid intake compared to younger individuals. However, this lack of responsiveness in elderly adults can be overcome with higher levels of protein (or essential amino acid) consumption. The requirement for a larger dose of protein to generate responses in elderly adults similar to the responses in younger adults provides the support for a beneficial effect of increased protein in older populations. The purpose of this review is to present the current evidence related to dietary protein intake and muscle health in elderly adults."

"The adequacy of plant-based diets in developed and developing countries as sources of protein and amino acids for human subjects of all ages is examined. Protein quantity is shown not to be an issue. Digestibility is identified as a problem for some cereals (millet (Panicum miliaceum) and sorghum (Sorghum sp.)) and generally is poorly understood. Direct measurements of biological value in children are reviewed and scoring is considered. Various existing requirement values for amino acids and especially lysine are reviewed, and it is concluded that stable-isotope studies do not yet provide adequate alternative values of N balance data, which for lysine are robust after recalculation and adjustment."

"Customs can act as “drags on social change” since, no matter what others do or believe, (perceived) need provides sufficient motivation. Even though eating meat on a regular basis is not a need for most people, it is often perceived as one (i.e., “necessary” in the 4Ns). But, as noted, dietary habits also involve norms further entrenching meat-eating behavior. We can capture the persistence of eating meat as a social norm, sustained by empirical and normative expectations also expressed by legal and market norms. It is more than a mere custom because the perception of need is not sufficient to sustain the practice.

[...]

Together, these normative features of omnivore practices constitute a drag on social change for animals. Furthermore, change is hindered by the phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance, whereby people infer that others hold attitudes consistent with their observed behavior."

"Dogs were first trained for police work at the turn of the 20th century in Ghent, Belg., and the practice was soon adopted elsewhere. Although certain breeds with especially keen senses have been used for special purposes—such as detecting caches of illegal drugs and explosives and tracking fugitives and missing persons—the most widely trained dog for regular patrol work is the German shepherd, or Alsatian. Other breeds that are sometimes used include boxers, Doberman pinschers, Airedale terriers, rottweilers, schnauzers, and bloodhounds. For detection tasks, the size of the animal is less important than its olfactory sensitivity. Selected animals must meet specific criteria regarding physical characteristics and temperament, and their training is comprehensive and rigorous."

Without them, life would be isolated and the chances of earning a liveable income limited."

“We don’t recommend it yet, just because the long-term studies haven’t been done,” says Justine Shotton, the president of the BVA. “While the short-term studies that we’ve seen suggest it could be just as good as other types of food, there hasn’t been the evidence base of lifelong studies of feeding these pets these foods.”

Traditional African meals consisted of yams, cassava, grains and vegetables. Food was prepared with local herbs and spices that not only taste good, but are also medicinal. Meat and fish were for special occasions for people who could afford it as local people were mainly farmers, and animal husbandry was not yet a thing. Regular meat is a colonial influence that has seen people buying into the idea that it is a social economic symbol of wealth and status."

"How can we overcome our built-in hunger drives for salt, sugar, and fat? We now have evidence showing that if we go a few weeks cutting down on junk food and animal products, our tastes start to change. We may actually be able to taste fat—just like we taste sweet, sour, and salty—and people on low fat diets start liking low fat foods more and high fat foods less.

Our tongues appear to become more sensitive to fat if we eat less of it. And the more sensitive our tongues become, the less butter, meat, dairy, and eggs study subjects ate. We also get a blunted taste for fat if we eat too much. This diminished fat sensitivity has been linked to eating more calories; more fat; more dairy, meat, and eggs; and becoming fatter ourselves. And this change in sensation, this numbing of our ability to taste fat, can happen within just a few weeks."

Try new, healthy foods several times and season them with flavors you like. Research shows pairing foods with familiar flavors repeatedly can increase your preference for those foods.

Practice mindful eating. Not only is mindful eating a stress-reducing practice, but it can also intensify the flavors and ultimately feel more satisfying eating a wholesome food than eating the unhealthy food you crave. Eventually, when your palate has lost its tolerance for really sweet or salty foods, a few mindful bites of a cupcake or potato chips will be more than enough if you decide to indulge."

It is the reason the waft of a barbecue is so appealing, why browned crusts on foods from bread to biscuits to a T-bone steak are the best bits, and why, when no one's looking, I frenziedly scrape up every last trace of caramelised meat juices from the dish as though I were raised by wolves. The intensity goes beyond mere caramelisation, which happens when sugars are heated (this goes for meat, too). The Maillard reaction was first identified by the French scientist Louis-Camille Maillard, a little over a century ago, and it occurs between amino acids and sugars at high temperatures. It unleashes a flavour bomb of about 1,000 volatile compounds, and it is why we always brown meat, even if it's not being roasted or grilled (sealing the juices in is a myth, by the way). We probably evolved to adore this aroma so that we preferred safely cooked meat to raw."

Scientific journals overflow with reports of red meat raising the risk of certain cancers; each hamburger contributes as much to global warming as does driving a car 320 miles; and the horrors of industrial meat production are now well-known.

None of these facts have prompted us to give up our hamburgers and steaks. On the contrary, meat consumption has only increased over the past decades. Taking the reader to India’s unusual steakhouses, animal sacrifices at temples in Benin, and labs in Pennsylvania where meat is being grown in petri dishes, Zaraska examines the history and future of meat and meat-eating, showing that while our increasing consumption of meat can be attributed in part to the power of the meat industry and the policies of our governments, the main “hooks” that keep us addicted to meat are much older: genes and culture."

"Colonized mindsets in developing countries render foods that are popular in white-dominated, wealthy nations as more desirable. Meat, especially red meat, has historically been a food of the rich. Anybody who could get hold of something as scarce and expensive as meat has always been considered of higher status. The Western, animal-rich foods offered by chain restaurants like McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut—which are largely viewed as symbols of Western culture—are sought by the growing middle-class in countries such as India and China as a way to demonstrate higher social status and identify themselves as ‘better.’ The social value attributed to Western foods has turned McDonald’s into a household name across the globe, with China, Japan, and Brazil among the top ten countries with the most locations outside of the U.S. Fast food corporations continue to exploit the colonized mindset that deems anything Western as superior."

At the other end of the spectrum, many of the world's poorest countries eat very little meat."

Making up about 5% of the world’s population, these communities live sustainably and responsibly off the earth – yet they often life in poverty, and are marginalised and brutalised by those who want their land. Climate change is set to exacerbate these problems.

This week we’ll be focusing on indigenous people: their vulnerabilities, and how they’re helping in the fight against climate change. We’ll be hearing from tribes in the Amazon, about why indigenous people could be key to a UN climate deal, and on how traditional knowledge is preserving the landscape in Kyrygzstan."

"A newly opened restaurant in Toronto sparked heated online debate recently by revealing that two dishes on its menu would contain seal meat. Kū-kŭm Kitchen, an Indigenous-owned and operated restaurant, was targeted by an online petition which gained more than 6,300 signatures. The petition called for the restaurant to remove seal from its menu, stating that seal hunting is “violent, horrific, traumatizing and unnecessary”.

The controversy again highlighted the often uncomfortable relationship between animal rights and environmental groups and Indigenous communities who are struggling with profound issues of poverty and deprivation.

In Toronto, the protest against Kū-kŭm Kitchen’s seal-based dishes prompted a counter-petition by local artist Aylan Couchie, who claims the original petition was ill-informed and that seal products hold historical and cultural significance for Indigenous communities."

"Carnism is essentially the opposite of veganism. “Carn” means “flesh” or “of the flesh” and “ism” refers to a belief system.

Because carnism is invisible, people rarely realize that eating animals is a choice, rather than a given. In meat-eating cultures around the world, people typically don’t think about why they eat certain animals but not others, or why they eat any animals at all. But when eating animals is not a necessity, which is the case for many people in the world today, then it’s a choice, and choices always stem from beliefs.

The tagline reads: “100% manly man. 100% pure beef”.

This McDonald’s advert, broadcast in China in 2012, relies on the well-trodden stereotype that meat is masculine. And oddly, there is actually some truth to this. It turns out that – in almost every part of the globe, from Sweden to Australia – there are significantly fewer male vegans and vegetarians.

Interviewees instead related their veganism to an ungoverning of masculine bodily ideals. Veganism was revealed in the interviews as entangled with men representing themselves as part of a progressive masculinity that engages with feminist ideas, even if they are sometimes misunderstood."

They lapse back to meat consumption.

That said, neither Bollard nor Zak Weston, a researcher at the Good Food Institute, thought direct monetary subsidies were the main reason meat was so cheap. More important are invisible forms of subsidization like not enforcing worker’s rights, exempting factory farms from animal cruelty laws, not requiring companies to engage in environmental cleanup, and not restricting practices — like antibiotic overuse — that impose costs on the whole world.

“It’s not the case that plant-based meat is weirdly expensive or labor intensive or something,” Weston told me. “The animal protein industry has spent decades wringing incredible efficiencies out of every part of the program. Animal meat gets to externalize a lot of its negatives — externalities like health care, ecological, worker welfare, animal welfare.”"

Over the last few years, not only have people started to appreciate the concept of veganism but have adopted it in their lives too.

"The ancient Indians were meat eaters. Their religion centered on the sacrifice of animals and consumption of their flesh. The sacrifices were administered by the Brahmin priests. Still, there is evidence that the seeds of vegetarianism may have been sown during the Vedic period (1700–1100 BCE), since occasionally a figure made of flour was substituted for the animal victim (Sen, 2015, pp.36–37)."

In fact, Indian adults are generally more likely to say that following dietary restrictions is a requirement for religious identity than to say that belief in God and prayer are essential. For instance, 72% of Hindus say someone cannot be Hindu if they eat beef, but fewer express the same sentiment about someone who does not believe in God (49%) or never prays (48%)."

The biggest myth, of course, is that India is a largely vegetarian country.

But that's not the case at all. Past "non-serious" estimates have suggested that more than a third of Indians ate vegetarian food.

If you go by three large-scale government surveys, 23%-37% of Indians are estimated to be vegetarian. By itself this is nothing remarkably revelatory.

But new research by US-based anthropologist Balmurli Natrajan and India-based economist Suraj Jacob, points to a heap of evidence that even these are inflated estimations because of "cultural and political pressures". So people under-report eating meat - particularly beef - and over-report eating vegetarian food.

Taking all this into account, say the researchers, only about 20% of Indians are actually vegetarian - much lower than common claims and stereotypes suggest."

One of the chief tenets of the Vedas was ahimsa, which means non-injury or non-violence to animals and humans. The Sanskrit-speaking people of the Rig Vedic society venerated the cattle as their chief source of wealth. Eating meat was frowned upon in the Rig Veda and other ancient texts, now considered holy scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita. The Rig Vedic stanza, 10.87.16-19, speaks harshly of meat-eaters.

The vegetarian practices in ancient India were known far and wide in the ancient world.

"As recent as 2018, William Haun wrote an article about animal blood sacrifices in West Africa, in a village called Tengzug. There were hundreds of small shrines. However, the most authoritative, prominent, and powerful deity represented was Tongnaab, whose name means “chief of the earth”.

Men approach the deities at the small shrines with their requests for help. These requests for help should be accompanied by a blood sacrifice. They seek different things such as fertility and prosperity. Therefore, a blood sacrifice becomes a transaction between a human being and a god. Blood is a spiritual currency. The animals for the blood sacrifices are chickens, goats, sheep, donkeys, cows, and even dogs. The spirits in these shrines are said to feed on the life-blood of the animals. Therefore, in exchange for a blessing, life has to be lost. These deities thus feed on life itself, for life is in the blood."

"It's still cold and rainy here, so the comfort food continues! This week has been filled with Vegan Lasagna, hearty Soup recipes, Baked Vegan Mac and Cheese, and this Vegan Shepherd's Pie.

I've always loved Shepherd's Pie but I never made my own version before, so I thought it would be fun to veganize Gordon Ramsay's Version. I'm not sure how happy Gordon would be about this, so thankfully we are at a safe distance.

I replaced the meat with finely chopped mushrooms and ground walnuts and used the rest of his recipe as a guide. His version also calls for grated onions and carrots which broke down and added to the texture of the vegan mince. I was pleasantly surprised!"

"Since the USDA has a vested interest in ensuring US farmers turn a profit, the organization’s standards for animal welfare are generally low. For example, though the USDA requires organic chicken access to the outdoors, a small screened porch would fit the requirements even if most of the chickens couldn’t get to the area due to overcrowding. Free-range meat is supposed to come from animals who were able to roam outside freely, but according to the Associated Press, USDA regulations for free-range chicken don’t “require the birds to actually spend time outdoors, only to have access.”"

"When Abraham held the blade to his son’s neck on Mount Arafat, the angel Gabriel appeared to prevent him from going through with it, saying he had already demonstrated his love for god. A goat was slaughtered in the boy’s stead.

Today, the same animal – or a sheep, cow or camel, depending on the region – is sacrificed in memory of the story.

The Qu’ran quotes the Prophet Muhammad as saying: “On the 10th of al-Hijjah, there is no better act in the view of Allah than shedding the blood. Hence you should offer it in good spirit.”

The point of the sacrifice is to kill something dear to man as an offering to the divine, as Abraham was prepared to do, serving as a reminder to followers of Islam not to become preoccupied by their possessions or lose sight of their spiritual compass."

Certainly, some partisans are focused on policy issues above all else. But for others, the brain’s tendency to stay the course may play a larger role. Psychological research suggests that once our minds are made up on important matters, changing them can be as difficult as stopping a train hurtling at full speed, even when there’s danger straight ahead.

Half of the participants were then provided an opportunity to express how incensed they were via a scale measuring moral outrage towards factory farm owners and operators. All participants then rated how guilty, regretful, and apologetic they felt about factory farming before rating how creative, funny, leadership-prone, fit, and sociable they considered themselves.

Results indicated that participants’ guilt decreased and favorable self-image increased when they were able to express moral outrage, which presumably "served to restore such individuals’ desires to feel moral and to reduce tension from the animal welfare concerns associated with eating meat,” Rothgerber et al. write."

"In the case of red meat, the classification is based on limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as well as strong mechanistic evidence.

Limited evidence means that a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other explanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or confounding) could not be ruled out. 

Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean?

This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed humans.

In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer."

Extensive systems use the natural range, valuable resources that is mostly nonarable land. In addition, the animal manure and urine are distributed over the range entering the natural carbon cycle, whereas the methane and carbon dioxide constitute recycling carbon. Extensive production, however, requires additional services that could contribute to the carbon footprint, which include veterinary support, supplementary feed where necessary such as licks, transport, electricity if not off-grid, and general goods and services."

"The wealthy island city of Singapore with an area of 710 square km and a population of 5 million, is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. With most parts of the island’s land utilized for urban development, the remaining 250 acres of farmland is hardly sufficient to feed the growing population. As a consequence, more than 90 percent of Singapore’s food consumption is met by imports from over 30 countries. This dependency on the external world makes the country highly vulnerable to turbulence in food supply and prices.

The only way out of this problem is to maximize the use of land for food production. For the island of Singapore, where real estate is at a premium and the land rates are exceptionally high, the only viable option is to go vertical to make the island more self-sufficient in food."

The study, which compared the cost of seven sustainable diets to the current typical diet in 150 countries, using food prices from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program, was published in The Lancet Planetary Health.

It found that in high-income countries:

- Vegan diets were the most affordable and reduced food costs by up to one third.
- Vegetarian diets were a close second.
- Flexitarian diets with low amounts of meat and dairy reduced costs by 14%.
- By contrast, pescatarian diets increased costs by up to 2%."

If you’re a beginner, it’s helpful to know which vegetables are easiest to grow from seed. Plus, growing from seed is less expensive, offers more variety, and has a higher success rate. Our list below includes vegetable seeds that can be sown directly into your garden soil. Some are also suitable for transplanting.

Green Beans

Beans grow even in fairly poor soils, because they fix the nitrogen as they go! Bush varieties don’t require trellising, but pole varieties provide a more extended harvest. In cool areas, snap beans are easiest.

Peas

Plant peas as soon as the soil can be worked—2 weeks before the average last spring frost for your region, if possible. To harvest a continuous supply of peas during the summer, simultaneously sow varieties with different maturity dates. Then sow more seeds about 2 weeks later. Continue this pattern, sowing no later than mid-June."

"In general, grains, fats, and sweets were associated with lower per-calorie food costs (energy cost, in E/100 kcal). By contrast, fruits and vegetables were associated with higher per-calorie food costs. As a result, the relation between the energy density of foods and the energy cost was negative. Figure 2 shows the negative relation between energy density and energy cost of foods, based on 2007 food prices in France. 

The results confirm previous findings obtained with 1997 food prices, with energy-dense foods such as fats and oils, added sugars, and refined grains providing calories at the lowest cost, while low-energy-density lean meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit are the most expensive energy sources. Similar findings have been obtained in the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands.

"There is no doubt that human evolution has been linked to meat in many fundamental ways. Our digestive tract is not one of obligatory herbivores; our enzymes evolved to digest meat whose consumption aided higher encephalization and better physical growth. Cooperative hunting promoted the development of language and socialization; the evolution of Old World societies was, to a significant extent, based on domestication of animals; in traditional societies, meat eating, more than the consumption of any other category of foodstuffs, has led to fascinating preferences, bans and diverse foodways; and modern Western agricultures are obviously heavily meat-oriented. In nutritional terms, the links range from satiety afforded by eating fatty megaherbivores to meat as a prestige food throughout the millennia of preindustrial history to high-quality protein supplied by mass-scale production of red meat and poultry in affluent economies."

Ruminants such as cattle, sheep, goats, llamas, alpacas, and white-tailed deer are mammals that have a multi-chambered stomach used to digest plant materials through fermentation.

Dr. Kevin Washburn, a professor of large animal internal medicine at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, explains the features of the ruminant digestive system and how owners of these animals can provide a healthy, complete diet.

The four components of a ruminant’s stomach are the reticulum, rumen, omasum, and abomasum."

"(a) Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system. However, in the rabbit the small intestine and cecum are enlarged to allow more time to digest plant material. The enlarged organ provides more surface area for absorption of nutrients. Rabbits digest their food twice: the first time food passes through the digestive system, it collects in the cecum, and then it passes as soft feces called cecotrophes. The rabbit re-ingests these cecotrophes to further digest them."

"Even if the trade-off between smaller guts and larger brains has not been as strong as is claimed by the expensive-tissue hypothesis, there is no doubt that the human digestive tract has clearly evolved for omnivory, not for purely plant-based diets.

[...]

Homo sapiens is thus a perfect example of an omnivorous species with a high degree of natural preferences for meat consumption, and only later environmental constraints (need to support relatively high densities of population by progressively more intensive versions of sedentary cropping) accompanied by cultural adaptations (meat-eating restrictions and taboos, usually embedded in religious commandments) have turned meat into a relatively rare foodstuff for majorities of populations (but not for their rulers) in traditional agricultural societies."

"It's possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of meat-eating and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws.

But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and meat-eating simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, "thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.""

"Although it is possible that the masticatory benefits of food processing and carnivory favoured selection for smaller teeth and jaws in Homo, we think it is more likely that tool use and meat-eating reduced selection to maintain robust masticatory anatomy, thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain. Whatever selection pressures favoured these shifts, however, they would not have been possible without increased meat consumption combined with food processing technology."

"Vegetarian, vegan and raw diets can be healthy — likely far healthier than the typical American diet. But to continue to call these diets "natural" for humans, in terms of evolution, is a bit of a stretch, according to two recent, independent studies.

Eating meat and cooking food made us human, the studies suggest, enabling the brains of our prehuman ancestors to grow dramatically over a period of a few million years.

Although this isn't the first such assertion from archaeologists and evolutionary biologists, the new studies demonstrate, respectively, that it would have been biologically implausible for humans to evolve such a large brain on a raw, vegan diet and that meat-eating was a crucial element of human evolution at least 1 million years before the dawn of humankind."

Someone discovered fire — no one knows exactly when — and then someone got around to putting steak and veggies on the barbeque. And people said, "Hey, let's do that again."

Besides better taste, cooked food had other benefits — cooking killed some pathogens on food.

But cooking also altered the meat itself. It breaks up the long protein chains, and that makes them easier for stomach enzymes to digest. "The second thing is very clear," Wrangham adds, "and that is the muscle, which is made of protein, is wrapped up like a sausage in a skin, and the skin is collagen, connective tissue. And that collagen is very hard to digest. But if you heat it, it turns to jelly.""

"But dining with dogs was worth it. Meat is packed with lots of calories and fat. Our brain — which uses about 20 times as much energy as the equivalent amount of muscle — piped up and said, "Please, sir, I want some more."

Carving Up The Diet

As we got more, our guts shrank because we didn't need a giant vegetable processor any more. Our bodies could spend more energy on other things like building a bigger brain. Sorry, vegetarians, but eating meat apparently made our ancestors smarter — smart enough to make better tools, which in turn led to other changes, says Aiello."
[474] https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/
"Eating meat is thought by some scientists to have been crucial to the evolution of our ancestors’ larger brains about two million years ago. By starting to eat calorie-dense meat and marrow instead of the low-quality plant diet of apes, our direct ancestor, Homo erectus, took in enough extra energy at each meal to help fuel a bigger brain. Digesting a higher quality diet and less bulky plant fiber would have allowed these humans to have much smaller guts. The energy freed up as a result of smaller guts could be used by the greedy brain, according to Leslie Aiello, who first proposed the idea with paleoanthropologist Peter Wheeler. The brain requires 20 percent of a human’s energy when resting; by comparison, an ape’s brain requires only 8 percent. This means that from the time of H. erectus, the human body has depended on a diet of energy-dense food—especially meat."

"Humans May Be the Most Adaptive Species

Constant climate change may have given Homo sapiens their flexibility

In the 5 million years since early hominids first emerged from east Africa's Rift Valley, the Earth's climate has grown increasingly erratic. Over cycles lasting hundreds of thousands of years, arid regions of central Africa were overrun by forests, forests gave way to grasslands and contiguous landscapes were fractured by deep lakes.

It was within the context of this swiftly changing landscape that humans evolved their sizable brains and capacity for adaptive behavior, said Rick Potts, director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History. In such a world, the ability to think creatively, to imagine novel solutions to survival threats, proved to be a major asset, he said."
[478] https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/natural-selection
"Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others. Individuals with adaptive traits—traits that give them some advantage—are more likely to survive and reproduce. These individuals then pass the adaptive traits on to their offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population. Through this process of natural selection, favorable traits are transmitted through generations."
[479] http://www.differencebetween.net/science/nature/difference-between-adaptation-and-evolution/
"Adaptation refers to the process wherein certain groups or individuals change their ways in order to be better suited to their environment and habitat. This is change is needed so that they can survive and maintain normal functioning in their community. For example, during winters or cold days, individuals learn to alter their homes and personal clothes to be able to live through the chilling temperatures.

Evolution, though, takes a long time. It is a process in which the genetic structure and physical anatomy change in relation to the changes happening in the environment. It does not occur overnight, but invokes generations in order to turn out into the best being suitable. Human beings are indeed an example, as evidenced from our ancestors the Homo erectus, to Homo sapiens, or basically, us. We are the proof of evolution."

Thus, rotating cotton with other crops could be a better system."

"In addition to our own attempts to justify meat-eating, advertising and marketing can make it easier for us to do so. According to research by sociologist Liz Grauerholz on images of animals in popular culture, one way to make meat-eating seem acceptable is to dissociate it from the animal it came from. Grauerholz argues that we do this by “transforming animals, which are loved, into meats, which are eaten, so that the concepts of ‘animals’ and ‘meats’ seem distinct and unrelated”. We call it “veal” instead of baby cow, “ham” instead of pig, “game” instead of hunted wild animal. We pack our dead animals in pretty packages – physically, verbally and conceptually distancing ourselves from the real origin of our food.

When looking at commercial depictions of meat, she found that this was done in two different ways."

As mentioned above, certain kinds of mushrooms are carnivorous. Oyster mushrooms (yes, the oyster mushrooms that everyone loves) are one of these species.

Oyster mushrooms and other kinds usually live on dead wood, so they only have a small amount of nitrogen. These fungi presume a carnivorous feeding pattern and eat small animals and worms to provide themselves with enough nutrients.

In addition, while plants can produce nutrients from sunlight, mushrooms can’t do this. They are saprophytes that live on rotting organic matter from plants, animals, or other fungi."

"Gauthier takes an “eat nothing with a face” approach to veganism. “For me, a vegan diet is fundamentally about compassion,” he explains, “and, as current research confirms, oysters are non-sentient beings with no brain or advanced central nervous system, so they’re unable to feel pain. That’s why I’m happy to eat them.” He accepts this view isn’t shared by all, which is why oysters don’t feature on his vegan menus. “There are plenty of other ingredients to choose from.”

Gauthier is not a lone voice, either. It turns out the “Are oysters vegan?” debate has been going on for decades, and while the naysayers are in a clear majority for obvious reasons, there are a surprising number of advocates out there."

"Those little insects are fig wasps, and they play an essential role in the fig's life cycle as the plant's only pollinator.

This arrangement is called mutualism. Both plant and wasp depend on the arrangement to survive, and without one, you wouldn't have the other.

But what happens when it's time to harvest the figs? Are the wasps still inside? Do the food companies scrape them out before they turn figs into jam? Or were the 12-year-olds right all along — are we really eating a mouthful of sweet baby wasp paste?"

Key findings include the observation that while grazing of grass-fed animals can boost the sequestration of carbon in some locally specific circumstances, that effect is time-limited, reversible, and at the global level, substantially outweighed by the greenhouse gas emissions they generate.

Explaining the key takeaways from the report, Dr Tara Garnett, co-author and founder of the FCRN, said: 'This report concludes that grass-fed livestock are not a climate solution. Grazing livestock are net contributors to the climate problem, as are all livestock. Rising animal production and consumption, whatever the farming system and animal type, is causing damaging greenhouse gas release and contributing to changes in land use."

Professor Day says that shark populations can suffer significant problems following culls and commercial fishing because of the risk of catching immature species.

Most shark species take a long time to reach maturity, especially the larger species such as the great white and tiger sharks; Professor Days says that bull sharks take about 15 years to reach maturity. Shark species living closest to the surface, which are more likely to be targeted in a cull, also take a long time to mature.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "feral" has three meanings: "existing in a wild or untamed state"; "having returned to an untamed state from domestication"; and "of, or suggestive of, a wild animal; savage". Importantly, the word is most commonly used in the second of those contexts, to describe domesticated animals that have left human society and control and now live on their own: we talk of populations of feral cats, for example."

""Any pig that gets out can revert back in a matter of months to a state where it can exist in the wild," said Brown. "It will get hairy, grow tusks and get aggressive. They're so good at adapting, and with their scavenging nature, they can get by pretty much anywhere.""

"The selection emphasis on production traits has clearly resulted in a decrease in fitness traits including fertility, health and welfare of livestock. Selection for welfare and health traits is complex and most of the time not part of routine

[516] https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/general/neutering
"What is neutering?

Let's start with a few basic facts about neutering:

- Females are spayed - this means the womb and the ovaries are removed.

- Males are castrated or snipped - this means the testicles are removed.

- It's done under general anaesthetic and your pet should recover quickly.

- Neutering shouldn't mean weight gain - your vet will be able to advise on this.

- You don't need to let your pet have one litter first - your vet will advise on the best time to neuter your pet."
[517] https://beef.ces.ncsu.edu/on-farm-castration-techniques-issues-and-whats-coming-part-one/
"Castrating young bulls prevents unwanted pregnancies in under-developed heifers, improves carcass quality (growth, tenderness, marbling, etc.), and decreases aggression toward pen mates and human handlers. However, the procedure is undeniably painful and causes significant stress to the animal castrated without the benefit of anesthesia or pain relievers."

"This can be hard work; involving a lot of patient waiting and test of wills against these naturally wary creatures which have had little or no human contact.

The trapped cats are taken swiftly to a veterinary surgery to be neutered, a straightforward procedure which will prevent the cat from breeding. At the same time, they will also have their ear ‘tipped’ – where between half and one cm of the tip of the left ear is removed under anaesthetic."
[519] https://www.aaalac.org/pub/?id=604A10D3-B59C-DBCF-50D6-7695C42B3A7D
"Yet, there is widespread veterinary acceptance of painful conditions and procedures in farm animals. This issue is linked to societal norms for a given country or region; cost and convenience of treating pain in food animals; education and awareness of pain occurrence and mitigation; as well as alternatives to painful practices, availability of licensed products for use in farm animals, and individual (i.e., producer and veterinary) ethical frameworks for managing and caring for animals and promoting their welfare."
[520] https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/what-are-trap-neuter-return-programs-in-cat-management/
"In TNR programs, unowned and semi-owned cats in urban or peri-urban areas are trapped, desexed, and then returned to their original location. Caretakers typically provide food and shelter and monitor the cats. Often when foster or permanent homes are available, young kittens and friendly adults are removed and placed for adoption."
[521] https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling.htm
"The biggest argument for hunting is that the sport controls overpopulated species that are running out of the natural resources they require to survive. By killing some, hunters make life easier on the others by reducing the need for competition. Now, throw selective culling into the hunting mix.

Many hunters think of selective culling as a humane way to hunt. They aren't killing animals that are strong and in the prime of their lives, but weak ones who probably struggle to get by. If they're diseased, they could be in a lot of pain with no chance of alleviation. Selective culling allows these animals a quick death, as opposed to what might be a long and painful natural death.

By killing the weakest link, some hunters believe that they've helped the herd by leaving it stronger than they found it. The weak member is often easier to track, allowing practice for new or unsure hunters. This also helps make an accurate shot less of a feat, producing a clean, quick kill."
[522] http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/is-hunting-moral/
"Therapeutic hunting involves intentionally killing wild animals in order to conserve another species or an entire ecosystem. In one example, Project Isabella, conservation groups hired marksmen to eradicate thousands of feral goats from several Galápagos islands between 1997 and 2006. The goats were overgrazing the islands, threatening the survival of endangered Galápagos tortoises and other species."

"As the wild hog population continues to grow, Texas’ love-hate relationship with the beasts veers toward hate. Michael Bodenchuk, director of the Texas Wildlife Services Program, notes that in 2009 the state killed 24,648 wild hogs, nearly half of them from the air (a technique most effective in areas where trees and brush provide little cover). “But that doesn’t really affect the total population much,” he adds. “We go into specific areas where they’ve gotten out of control and try to bring that local population down to where the landowners can hopefully maintain it.”"

[527] http://www.placermosquito.org/programs/biological-and-physical-control/
"Biological control uses natural enemies to help manage mosquito populations. There are several types of biological control like the direct introduction of parasites, pathogens and predators to target mosquitoes. We use mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, a predatory fish that feeds on mosquito larvae as a preventative biological control agent against mosquitoes to reduce mosquito larvae from a water source. Mosquitofish are applied by our trained technicians to sites where they are likely to be successful in controlling mosquitoes and unlikely to escape into natural bodies of water."

"Cultural Control

Cultural control techniques address the manner in which we cultivate plants and are directed at reducing and avoiding pest problems. At the heart of cultural control are practices to maintain plant health. Healthy plants have fewer pest problems and are more tolerant of pests."
[529] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964823/pdf/pntd.0007831.pdf
"Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are infections caused by pathogens that are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes, triatomine bugs, blackflies, tsetse flies, sand flies, lice, and ticks. Dengue, Chagas disease, Japanese encephalitis, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis (LF), malaria, and yellow fever threaten over 80% of the world’s population and disproportionately affect the poorest populations living in the tropics and subtropics.

[…]

Vector control is the principal method available for controlling many VBDs—both historically and today. Moreover, for some diseases, such as dengue (a vaccine is licensed but is not widely used due to safety concerns), chikungunya, Zika, and West Nile disease, vector control is currently the only method available to protect populations. Vector control aims to limit the transmission of pathogens by reducing or eliminating human contact with the vector."
[530] https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/natural-selection/
"Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others. Individuals with adaptive traits—traits that give them some advantage—are more likely to survive and reproduce. These individuals then pass the adaptive traits on to their offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population. Through this process of natural selection, favorable traits are transmitted through generations."
[531] https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling2.htm
"At least hunters still have that conservation argument to back them up, right? Well, maybe not. Some experts and animal advocates see hunting as an unnecessary means of population control. They say that when left alone, deer and many other animal species can regulate their own population through natural selection. The lion preying on the weak antelope is an example of nature taking a natural course. There might be increased competition for natural resources, but that will simply lead to the survival of the fittest (which is basically nature's version of culling)."

"Modern cattle owe their existence to selective breeding by human beings: they are very different animals from the wild oxen from which they are descended. We might think that this difference is relevant to their moral value. We might think, that is, along the following lines: we have a duty to preserve the natural world as far as we can. Wolves and pandas belong to that natural world; they occupy their place in it due to the mechanisms of evolution. So we have a duty to preserve them (not an absolute duty of course: rather one duty among many others – to our children, to each other, and so on – each of which makes different and sometimes conflicting demands on us).

But cows don’t belong to the natural world, because they owe their existence to our selective breeding, not evolution. For that reason, we might think, we have no duty to preserve them as a species: what we created we may dispose of."

However, infertility is a problem to some degree in all animal production systems, including aquaculture species. Reproductive failure is one of the most significant factors that limit the productivity of animal production systems and result in millions of dollars in lost profits annually. A major challenge facing many producers is finding practical, cost-effective ways to improve reproductive performance without compromising the production of safe, high quality meat and milk products."

"It is therefore concluded that continuous operation of this abattoir within the residential area can constitute a great environmental menace to the residents of the area and can result in complication to those with existing health challenge. It is therefore recommended that the abattoir be moved to a designated area outside residential vicinity where the effects will be minimal.

These rules are based on the European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes and they reflect the so-called 'Five Freedoms':

"Some aspects of the experience and expression of pain are not likely to be the same as in humans. First, animals cannot verbally communicate their pain. Dogs may yelp and you may notice behaviour change but what about your pet rabbit, cat, tortoise or horse? Animals rely on human observers to recognise pain and to evaluate its severity and impact. Without the ability to understand soothing words that explain that following surgery to repair a bone fracture, their pain will be managed (hopefully) and will subside, animals may also suffer more when in pain than we do."

"In fact, most modern apes with whom we share recent ancestry have no such instinct. The exception is the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodyte), where territory-based “wars” have been documented. These chimps may be what Marcello had in mind when he notes that “In humans and other high primates, the killing instinct is tribal; we join tribes, find safety in them, and protect them with all we’ve got.” In fact, no such war behavior has been reported for bonobos, gorillas or orangutans, all of whom live in tribes, nor even in most chimp communities. So it’s not exactly a higher-primate given.

But given the possibility of our mixed-bag ancestry, let’s go ahead and posit that a chimp-related killer instinct could be a feature of our inherited nature.

But inherited human nature? Not so fast."

"Humans have short, soft fingernails and small “canine” teeth. In contrast, carnivores all have sharp claws and large canine teeth that are capable of tearing flesh.

Carnivores’ jaws move only up and down, requiring them to tear chunks of flesh from their prey and swallow them whole. Humans and other herbivores can move their jaws up and down and from side to side, allowing them to grind up fruit and vegetables with their back teeth. Like other herbivores’ teeth, humans’ back molars are flat for grinding fibrous plant foods.

Dr. Richard Leakey, a renowned anthropologist, summarizes, “You can’t tear flesh by hand, you can’t tear hide by hand. Our anterior teeth are not suited for tearing flesh or hide. We don’t have large canine teeth, and we wouldn’t have been able to deal with food sources that require those large canines.”"

Exposed and relatively defenseless, our predecessors stood a good chance of being eaten by bigger, badder, species. For most of our evolutionary history as primates, we were far more likely to play the role of Big Mac than Big Man on Campus. Our ancestors evolved many traits to help them escape that fate—if not forever, at least long enough to reproduce and pass their genes along. These responses still frame how our bodies work today, which would be great if we were still being stalked by large cats. But Vegas performers notwithstanding, most of us are not."

The research, published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that humans today are hard-wired to pay attention to other people and animals much more so than non-living things, even if inanimate objects are the primary hazards for modern, urbanized folks.

The researchers say the finding supports the idea that natural selection molded mechanisms into our ancestors' brains that were specialized for paying attention to humans and other animals. These adaptive traits were then passed on to us."

"A liberty right would indicate that an animal is free to engage in or avoid certain behaviours, in the sense of being free from a specific duty to do otherwise. Yet, an obvious objection is that animals are generally incapable of having any legal duties. Given that animals are inevitably in a constant state of ‘no duty’ and thus ‘liberty’, this seems to render the notion of liberty rights somewhat pointless and redundant in the case of animals, as it would do nothing more than affirm an already and invariably existing natural condition of dutylessness."
[567] https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/rights/
"Negative rights, such as the right to privacy, the right not to be killed, or the right to do what one wants with one's property, are rights that protect some form of human freedom or liberty. These rights are called negative rights because such rights are a claim by one person that imposes a "negative" duty on all others—the duty not to interfere with a person's activities in a certain area. The right to privacy, for example, imposes on us the duty not to intrude into the private activities of a person.

Kant's principle is also often used to justify positive or, as they are often called, welfare rights.

"What is it to be a person? Frankfurt argues that the difference between a person and an animal (human or otherwise) which is not a person is a difference in the structure of will. Frankfurt notes that humans have a characteristic other animals do not: Human persons can form desires for and against particular desires for and against actions. Presumably animals have so-called first order desires, but only human persons can form second order desires."

"One important difference between humans and animals is the extent to which humans employ huge amounts of knowledge and technology. While it is true that some animals build structures (think, for instance, of beaver dams) and that some use tools (with the New Caledonian crow being an exceptional instance), humans not only have a large and varied tool-kit, but also use this tool-kit to survive in almost all the terrestrial territories of the globe."

Our bodies have 3 billion genetic building blocks, or base pairs, that make us who we are.

"Along with tool use, humans share many cognitive abilities with other species, including the formation of memories, categories, basic emotions such as anger, planning and goal-setting, and rule learning. These kinds of basic nonverbal concepts likely predicated language by many millions of years of evolution. Unlike tool use, language appears to be a trait that only humans possess. However, most of the component parts of language are shared with other species, Fitch said.

the fundamental tendency of humans and nonhuman animals to behave so as to avoid injury and maximize chances of survival (e.g., by fleeing from dangerous situations or predators). In his early formulations of classic psychoanalytic theory, Sigmund Freud proposed that self-preservation was one of two instincts that motivated human behavior, the other being the sexual instinct. In his later formulations, he combined both instincts into the concept of Eros, or the life instinct, and opposed them to Thanatos, the death instinct. Also called self-preservative instinct; survival instinct."

Therefore, it is now subject to the same legal procedures as human beings. This raises embarrassing practical questions, for who will defend the animal in court? And will the animal be able to comprehend what is going on? History provides us with a great variety of absurd trials involving animals."

"Humans have a moral sense because their biological makeup determines the presence of three necessary conditions for ethical behavior: (i)the ability to anticipate the consequences of one’s own actions; (ii)the ability to make value judgments; and (iii) the ability to choose between alternative courses of action. Ethical behavior came about in evolution not because it is adaptive in itself but as a necessary consequence of man’s eminent intellectual abilities, which are an attribute directly promoted by natural selection. That is, morality evolved as an exaptation, not as an adaptation. Moral codes, however, are outcomes of cultural evolution, which accounts for the diversity of cultural norms among populations and for their evolution through time."

He has argued that, while animals probably lack the sorts of concepts and metacognitive capacities necessary to be held morally responsible for their behaviour, this only excludes them from the possibility of counting as moral agents. There are, however, certain moral motivations that, in his view, may be reasonably thought to fall within the reach of (at least some) animal species, namely, moral emotions such as “sympathy and compassion, kindness, tolerance, and patience, and also their negative counterparts such as anger, indignation, malice, and spite”, as well as “a sense of what is fair and what is not” (Rowlands 2012, 32)."

"However, it seems that many plants can perceive and communicate physical stimuli and damage in ways that are more sophisticated than previously thought.

Some plants have obvious sensory abilities, such as the Venus flytrap and its incredible traps that can close in about half a second. Similarly, the sensitive plant rapidly collapses its leaves in response to touch, an adaptation that might serve to startle away potential herbivores. While these plants visibly display a clear sensory capacity, recent research has shown that other plants are able to perceive and respond to mechanical stimuli at a cellular level. Arabidopsis (a mustard plant commonly used in scientific studies) sends out electrical signals from leaf to leaf when it is being eaten by caterpillars or aphids, signals to ramp up its chemical defenses against herbivory."

"Abstract—Bacteria adapt rapidly to changes in ambient conditions, constantly inspecting their surroundings by means of their sensor systems. These systems are often thought to respond only to signals of a chemical nature. Yet, bacteria are often affected by mechanical forces, e.g., during transition from planktonic to sessile state. Mechanical stimuli, however, have seldom been considered as the signals bacteria can sense and respond to. Nonetheless, bacteria perceive mechanical stimuli, generate signals, and develop responses. This review analyzes the information on the way bacteria respond to mechanical stimuli and outlines how bacteria convert incoming signals into appropriate responses."

"The possibility of conscious experiences of emotions in non-human animals has been much less explored than that of conscious experiences associated with carrying out complex cognitive tasks. However, no great cognitive powers are needed to feel hunger or pain and it may be that the capacity to feel emotions is widespread in the animal kingdom. Since plants can show surprisingly sophisticated ‘‘choice’’ and ‘‘decision-making’’ mechanisms and yet we would not wish to imply that they are conscious, attribution of emotions to animals has to be done with care. Whether or not an animal possesses anticipatory mechanisms associated with positive and negative reinforcement learning may be a guide as to whether it has evolved emotions."

""We don't know why they have them, whether this was just conserved through evolution or if it performs some sort of information processing function. We don't know. There's a lot we don't know," Pollan says.

And chalk up another human-like ability — memory. 

Pollan describes an experiment done by animal biologist Monica Gagliano. She presented research that suggests the mimosa pudica plant can learn from experience. And, Pollan says, merely suggesting a plant could learn was so controversial that her paper was rejected by 10 scientific journals before it was finally published.

Mimosa is a plant, which looks something like a fern, that collapses its leaves temporarily when it is disturbed. So Gagliano set up a contraption that would drop the mimosa plant, without hurting it. When the plant dropped, as expected, its leaves collapsed. She kept dropping the plants every five to six seconds."

"The evidence for plant communication is only a few decades old, but in that short time it has leapfrogged from electrifying discovery to decisive debunking to resurrection. Two studies published in 1983 demonstrated that willow trees, poplars and sugar maples can warn each other about insect attacks: Intact, undamaged trees near ones that are infested with hungry bugs begin pumping out bug-repelling chemicals to ward off attack. They somehow know what their neighbors are experiencing, and react to it. The mind-bending implication was that brainless trees could send, receive and interpret messages.

The first few “talking tree” papers quickly were shot down as statistically flawed or too artificial, irrelevant to the real-world war between plants and bugs. Research ground to a halt. But the science of plant communication is now staging a comeback."

"Like the Ents from JRR Tolkien’s epic Lord of the Rings saga (only a bit slower), these trees actually move across the forest as the growth of new roots gradually relocates them, sometimes two or three centimetres per day. While some scientists debate whether these trees walk, Peter Vrsansky, a palaeobiologist from the Earth Science Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences Bratisla, claims to have seen this phenomenon first hand.

“As the soil erodes, the tree grows new, long roots that find new and more solid ground, sometimes up to 20m,” said Vrsansky. “Then, slowly, as the roots settle in the new soil and the tree bends patiently toward the new roots, the old roots slowly lift into the air. The whole process for the tree to relocate to a new place with better sunlight and more solid ground can take a couple of years.”"

"What are carnivorous plants?

Carnivorous plants attract, trap and digest animals for the nutrients they contain. There are currently around 630 species of carnivorous plant known to science.

Although most meat-eating plants consume insects, larger plants are capable of digesting reptiles and small mammals. Smaller carnivorous plants specialise in single-celled organisms (such as bacteria and protozoa) and aquatic examples also eat crustaceans, mosquito larvae and small fish.

Carnivory is such an efficient adaptation that it has evolved independently several times and occurs in unrelated plant families.

But while it's great for a nutrient top-up, carnivory doesn't replace the need for photosynthesis and root systems. Being carnivorous simply helps the plants make the most of all available resources."

"To protect themselves, plants employ a volley of molecular responses. These chemical communications can be used to poison an enemy, alert surrounding plants to potential dangers or attract helpful insects to perform needed services [source: Krulwich]. Sometimes, a plant's molecular defense plays double-duty. For example, plants that produce caffeine use the chemical as self-defense, but it also gives bees a caffeine buzz. The caffeinated bees treat the plant like it's the corner coffee shop, returning again and again and leaving their pollination services as payment.

Clearly, plants can communicate. But does that mean they can feel pain? It's a troubling scenario for salad lovers squeamish at the thought of eating foods with feelings, and for them the answer may not be that appetizing."

Another experiment, done in Mancuso’s lab and not yet published, found that plant roots would seek out a buried pipe through which water was flowing even if the exterior of the pipe was dry, which suggested that plants somehow “hear” the sound of flowing water."

Along with honey bees, wild bees are also vital for crop pollination. Research has shown that the presence of wild bees increases yields across many types of crops. They often are more efficient at pollinating crops native to North America than honey bees. For example, a honey bee would have to visit a blueberry flower four times to deposit the same amount of pollen as a single visit from a bumble bee queen."

"Oil palm is one of the world's most rapidly increasing crops. We assess its contribution to tropical deforestation and review its biodiversity value. Oil palm has replaced large areas of forest in Southeast Asia, but land-cover change statistics alone do not allow an assessment of where it has driven forest clearance and where it has simply followed it. Oil palm plantations support much fewer species than do forests and often also fewer than other tree crops. Further negative impacts include habitat fragmentation and pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. With rising demand for vegetable oils and biofuels, and strong overlap between areas suitable for oil palm and those of most importance for biodiversity, substantial biodiversity losses will only be averted if future oil palm expansion is managed to avoid deforestation."

Greedy businesses cut down the trees and leave the animals homeless and starving to death. Friends of the Earth thinks that the situation is now so bad that orang-utans could be extinct in just 12 years. As people who care about animals, we all need to remember that veganism goes beyond the food on our plate.

The large majority of palm oil production occurs in just two countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, where huge swaths of tropical forests and peatlands (carbon-rich swamps) are being cleared to make way for oil palm plantations, releasing carbon into the atmosphere to drive global warming while shrinking habitats for a multitude of endangered species."

"Another benefit of the secure indoor growing environment is the protection it provides the plants against harmful pests and microbial diseases. Traditional agriculture makes use of intense applications of herbicides and pesticides to shield crops from natural threats, though these chemicals have become under increasing scrutiny for the adverse effects they pose to humans and surrounding ecosystems. Pesticides often contaminate surface water, are toxic to many non-targeted insects, animals and plants, can eliminate positive and healthy soil microbes, and have been linked to breast cancer in humans. In the United States, more than 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used annually, 90% of which is used by the agriculture industry.

"Specifically, how those who follow a vegan lifestyle are responsible for more animal deaths - through the harvesting of crops and use of fertilisers and pesticides - than people who choose to consume animals directly.

We do see this comment quite often and it’s about time we took a good look at the argument being made. Are animals killed in plant production? Yes, but it’s not just vegans eating plants, especially soy - of all the crops to choose. In fact, around 75 to 80 per cent of the soy that is produced is used as farmed animal feed and only 6 per cent is actually used for human consumption. Therefore, if you are upset about animals being killed in soy farming, then stop funding the industries that use three-quarters of all the soy that is grown."

"Pesticides have been an integral part of the process by reducing losses from the weeds, diseases and insect pests that can markedly reduce the amount of harvestable produce. Warren (1998) also drew attention to the spectacular increases in crop yields in the United States in the twentieth century. Webster et al. (1999) stated that “considerable economic losses” would be suffered without pesticide use and quantified the significant increases in yield and economic margin that result from pesticide use."
[612] http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/vegans-kill-animals-too
"Crop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. However, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many more plants are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food (often as high as 12:1) than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food (which is obviously 1:1). Because of this, a plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals.

[...]

It is also noteworthy that the accidental deaths caused by growing and harvesting plants for food are ethically distinct from the intentional deaths caused by breeding and slaughtering animals for food. This is not to say that vegans are not responsible for the deaths they cause, but rather to point out that these deaths do not violate the vegan ethics stated above."

A strategy of 3 Rs (i.e. reduction, refinement and replacement) is being applied for laboratory use of animals. Different methods and alternative organisms are applied to implement this strategy. These methods provide an alternative means for the drug and chemical testing, up to some levels. A brief account of these alternatives and advantages associated is discussed in this review with examples. An integrated application of these approaches would give an insight into minimum use of animals in scientific experiments."

"The drug research process is complicated, time-consuming, and costly; and the end result is never known at the outset. Literally hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of chemical compounds must be made and tested to find one that can achieve the desirable result without too serious side effects.

Such a complicated process costs vast amounts of time and money. The FDA estimates that, on average, it takes eight-and-a-half years to study and test a new drug before the agency can approve it for the general public. That includes early laboratory and animal testing, as well as later clinical trials using human subjects."

"Industrial egg-laying hens have been bred to produce more and faster, laying about 320 eggs over a life span of about 72 weeks, compared with a productive life of around four years in more traditional breeds that lay at a fraction of the rate. This high intensity of production tends to affect their bones, which can become brittle and easily broken; the birds become stressed – which is why beak clipping is necessary – and listless."

"But the approach is opposed by animal rights groups because the separation is stressful for both the mother and the calf. Studies suggest that calves reared by their mothers are likely to gain more weight, have better health and enjoy improved social behaviour. The RSPCA says there could also be health benefits for dams who stay with their offspring, including a reduction in the incidence of mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland and udder tissue)."

"The number of male calves being killed straight after birth is on the rise again, despite efforts by the dairy industry to end the practice known as ‘the dirty secret’.

A Guardian analysis shows that it can cost a farmer up to £30 per calf to sell it on for beef or veal, while early disposal costs just £9. A growing number of farmers feel compelled to take the latter option, with 95,000 killed on-farm in the most recent set of figures."

"Farm animal welfare may also affect the quality of the end product. Temple Grandin and others have done extensive research demonstrating that meat quality improves when you reduce stress in cattle at slaughter. Poor animal welfare occurring during transport and lairage can also result in reduced quality of product."

"Fifty years ago, before the coming of giants, this country’s cows, pigs and poultry were mostly raised outdoors and sold, for whatever the spot market bore, at livestock auctions for cash. Then Tyson, Perdue and others set about gobbling up feed lots, van lines, slaughterhouses and hatcheries, ran them, top-down, via corporate committees, and turned farmers into wage slaves on their lands, owners of nothing but the mortgages on their barns. With the craven consent of the Department of Agriculture (then, as now, a revolving door for executives in the big-farm sector), they devoured smaller companies, corraled much of the nation’s livestock and began treating animals as production units, not living, feeling creatures with basic rights. Their motto: maximum profit for minimum input, meaning far fewer workers tending vastly larger stocks, and animals confined in tight, dark spaces for the ease and convenience of staff."

"In many places across the country, state laws prohibiting cruelty to animals do not exclude species commonly used for food from protection—even when they’re inside slaughterhouses.

That’s why PETA digs through records to discover exactly how animals are killed in slaughterhouses and urges authorities to investigate botched killings or any other incidents of suspected cruelty that we find. When appropriate, anyone found to have committed an act of cruelty inside a slaughterhouse should be slapped with charges."

"One of the main objective measurements for carcass compliance is the ultimate pH of the longissimus thoracis et lumborum; however, recent research has demonstrated that pre-slaughter stress is eroding beef eating quality in pH compliant carcasses. Pre-slaughter mixing and transport was associated with lower eating quality in certain cuts. A two-week rest period at the abattoir prior to slaughter was beneficial for improving consumer sensory eating quality scores. Further research is required to determine if the muscle damage enzyme creatine kinase could be used commercially as an objective measurement to identify which cattle could benefit from a pre-slaughter rest period to improve beef quality."
[626] https://www.britannica.com/topic/foie-gras
"foie gras, (French: “fat liver”) a delicacy of French cuisine, the liver of a goose or duck that has been fattened by a process of force-feeding. What is generally regarded as the best foie gras is produced in the province of Strasbourg. Foie gras is ideally very firm and smoothly textured, with a colouring of creamy white tinged with pink.

[...]

At the beginning of the 21st century, animal rights proponents drew attention to foie gras production, arguing that force-feeding birds through long tubes stuck down their throats was inhumane and that it caused livers to become diseased. In 2006 Chicago became the first city in the United States to enact a ban against restaurants serving the dish, but the ban was repealed two years later."

"Curved chutes fix an obvious problem. When cattle see what they’re in for, they become panicked and stressed. They ram into each other, try to spin around, and slip to the ground, injuring themselves. Grandin realized that curved chutes shield them from viewing what’s ahead, keeping them calm. The arched shape also plays to cattle instinct, which is to walk in a circle back to where they came.

The center-track restrainer is a conveyor belt-like piece of machinery. It works and looks like a bowling ball return system. Cattle straddle a track that lifts them up by the belly and propels them forward. It holds them steady during the final moment of slaughter, so that handlers can stun cattle with maximum effectiveness—a crucial moment of animal welfare, because nothing’s worse than a botched attempt to kill an animal."

"The scientific basis for the phenomenon is well-established, and it's frequently been discussed as a reason to make slaughterhouse practices more humane. The key ingredient here is lactic acid: in an unstressed animal, after death, muscle glycogen is converted into lactic acid, which helps keep meat tender, pink, and flavorful. Adrenaline released by stress before slaughter uses up glycogen, which means there's not enough lactic acid produced postmortem. This affects different kind of meat in different ways, but in general it'll be tough, tasteless, and high in pH, and will go bad quicker than unstressed meat. (Lactic acid helps slow the growth of spoilage bacteria.)"
[629] https://foodanimalconcernstrust.org/what-is-a-humane-farm/
"We believe there is a better, more humane way to raise farm animals. At minimum, farm animals deserve adequate space, access to the outdoors, clean water and air, the opportunity to express their natural behaviors, and healthful feed. Furthermore, FACT believes that living conditions should allow food animals to live and feed without aggression from other animals, including predators and members of their species.

“Humane farming” may seem like a vague or loosely defined term, but FACT maintains a set of strict beliefs and principles on how we define humane farming. Animals should receive antibiotics only for treatment of disease or illness, as prescribed by a veterinarian. Antibiotics, hormones, or other substances should not be used to promote faster animal growth. All animals should be fed a natural diet free of animal by-products and have continuous access to clean and well-ventilated housing or shelter that protects them from weather extremes."

"Current UK law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes. However, exemptions are allowed that permit non-stun slaughter for religious purposes, i.e. Muslim and Jewish communities.

We acknowledge that religious beliefs and practices should be respected. However, all animals should be treated humanely at the time of killing and therefore be stunned prior to slaughter."

"The whole point of shechita - the only method of slaughter by which Jews are permitted to eat kosher meat and poultry - is to be fast and humane.

The shochet, who performs shechita, undergoes years of training. A perfectly clean and swift incision with a surgically sharp instrument (chalef) severs the structures at the front of the neck - the trachea, oesophagus, carotid arteries and jugular veins.

The speed and precision of the incision ensures the lack of stimulation of the severed structures and results in the immediate loss of consciousness. Blood flow to the brain is completely halted."
[632] https://www.asidcom.org/IMG/pdf/ASIDCOM_report-Benefits_of_religious_slaughter-2.pdf
"This deep, large cut through all the blood vessels of the neck causes acute blood loss and haemorrhagic shock: we know the blood is under great pressure, especially in the big carotid arteries (systolic pressure) and at high speed and, according to physical law, the pressure always goes from the higher to lower resistance - the point of the cut is the point of low resistance for blood to and from the brain. As there is a fully intact, alive heart, most of the blood is going to be pumped and poured out quickly under pressure leading to a rapid fall in the blood pressure. Thus depriving the brain of its main source of oxygen and glucose, and with no blood which is necessary to keep the animal alive and functioning and able to deal with any perceptive sensation this leads to anoxia and almost immediate loss of consciousness (anesthetization or “stunning”)."

"In the fourth appeal to care, hunters purport to alleviate suffering for animals when they kill them. Whether rhetoric or conviction, hunting defenders use the so-called harvest-or-holocaust defense: “we shoot ‘em to save ‘em”. They purport sparing animals from what they term ‘nature’s grisly drama’ with natural deaths involving far more suffering (Loftin, 1984; McLeod, 2007). To Cahoone (2009), the suffering of animals killed in hunting is not a moral harm unless it exceeds the suffering of an animal in a wild death. He suggests that the ‘natural’ fates of a wild animal involving disease, starvation, nutritional stress and predation, are more gruesome than a hunter’s rifle. As Rolston argues: “Bullets inflict no more pain than do the fangs of a cougar but rather less. The argument is then that hunting is acceptable, even a mercy, if it does not inflict ‘unnecessary suffering’."

"Of all their cons, the “free range” egg is perhaps the most audacious. You’d need Disney-level imagination to believe the UK can produce more than 10bn eggs each year without inconveniencing any chickens. But by slapping “free range” on the label, and perhaps a nice pastoral scene with a few chickens roaming free, most consumers never realise how the eggs came to be in the box.

The question of the ethical egg is back on the agenda after the government ordered that, in the face of bird flu, poultry must be kept indoors until at least the end of February. This means “free range” eggs may have to be renamed “barn eggs”. Yet whatever they’re called, few shoppers realise what “free range” means and what routine horrors are allowed under its reassuring banner."

"A ‘less and better’ way forward 

Meat in moderation is not unhealthy, but we need to think differently about how we produce it and how much we eat. We can unpick the complexity of the food system we have created and farm in a more natural way. That means a phasing out of industrial livestock farming and a scaling up of agroecological and regenerative practices, where farmers work to restore and enhance nature, boost soil fertility and protect precious water resources. Livestock numbers are reduced and animals are free to roam, in pasture-fed systems, ending the reliance on imported feed which drives deforestation. This is the ‘less and better’ approach."

"If I was to meet all my hens’ welfare needs, would it be ethical to eat the eggs?

Some people say it’s beneficial to feed eggs back to the hens, but what if there are more eggs than your little flock will eat? If I had hens, I would monitor their behaviour closely for signs of broodiness or distress when their eggs are taken; according to hen-keepeing websites the signs of broodiness are very easy to spot (for examples see here and here).

If there are no signs of distress, I would find it difficult to identify anything obviously unethical about taking the eggs (as opposed to just leaving them in the paddock to rot)."

"Perhaps the most realistic way to recreate a meat without the carbon footprint will be to grow it in a lab. Cultured meats – meat grown in labs from cells – would use far less energy, land, water and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions than traditional meat, and they are the subject of extensive international research. But even cultured meats are some way off being convincingly meat-like, let alone commercially available.

The first cultured meats were "unstructured" collections of tissue grown in gels that lacked the fibrous texture of a whole cut of meat (they even lacked the red colour of raw flesh – that had to be added in with dyes). After all, whole cuts of meat are more than just protein – they are fat, blood vessels and connective tissues. The bundles of fat and muscle cells that were produced in early cell cultures made for more convincing burgers than steaks."

Yes, the cost may be a bit more, but if you eat meat, the higher costs may be worth the investment if you want what you’re eating to have a positive impact on your health and our environment. So the question to ask yourself is, “why are you not willing to pay for it?”"

Halal is Arabic for permissible. Halal food is that which adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Koran.

The Islamic form of slaughtering animals or poultry, dhabiha, involves killing through a cut to the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe.

Animals must be alive and healthy at the time of slaughter and all blood is drained from the carcass. During the process, a Muslim will recite a dedication, know as tasmiya or shahada."

"Factory farming facts and statistics

There is a lot to learn about factory farming, and given the sheer size of this growing industry, the numbers are often difficult to fathom. Below are a few facts and statistics that form a brief snapshot of intensive animal agriculture.

- Factory farming is driving the consolidation of farms in the United States. The total number of farms in the US decreased by 50 percent between 1960 and 2002, while the total number of farmed animals skyrocketed.

- As of 2020, there are roughly 1.6 billion animals confined within the 25,000 factory farms spread across the United States.

- Roughly 99 percent of animals in the US are raised on factory farms.

- A single broiler chicken factory farm can produce about 500,000 birds every year."
[648] https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/chart-shows-worlds-land-used/
"As the chart details, 71 percent of our land is considered habitable, and half of that land is used for agriculture. Of that 50 percent, 77 percent is used for livestock, either as land for grazing or land to grow animal feed. However, despite taking up such a giant percentage of agricultural land, meat and dairy only make up 17 percent of global caloric supply and 33 percent of global protein supply. As Our World in Data sums up, “In other words, the 11 million square kilometers used for crops supply more calories and protein for the global population than the almost four-times larger area used for livestock."

Unless you have ties to Indian or Rastafarian culture, it was probably Alicia Silverstone, Pamela Anderson, Moby or one of the other famous folks who helped bring veganism into the mainstream in the late 1990s. In fact, take a peek at this list of vegan celebrities.

"But these ideologies and traditions had flourished in communities of color for centuries prior, if not longer. Eastern religions like Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism all advocate eschewing animals and animal products in some format because of the belief systems centered around nonviolence.

Cruelty-free eating is also a strong thread in Rastafarianism, where followers, who reject unhealthy manners of living, engage in a way of eating know as Ital, stemming from the word "vital." The diet, encouraging plant-based unprocessed meals, was developed in the 1930s in Jamaica, and is believed to have evolved from Hindu traditions brought over with indentured Indian servants, according to the Miami New Times. The Black Hebrew Israelite community, which was established in the late 19th century, also adheres to a strict vegan diet, believing it to be the secret to eternal life."

Moreover, I contended that, despite the fact that many animal advocates engage in white normativity and that there is, indeed, a problem of this being widespread, animal advocacy is not inherently white normative. Rather, there are already groups engaging in a more inclusive approach and aspects of the animal movement that can potentially promote more integrative approaches.

Last year, a vegan Twitter account released an image of a black man hanging from a tree next to a pig. The tagline read “Then we had racism, now we have speciesism” (the tweet has since been deleted, but can be seen in this article).

This isn’t the first time that a controversial ad relating the meat industry to an act of racial oppression has sparked controversy. In 2003, PETA (who is no stranger to controversial advertising) released an ad relating the poultry industry to the Holocaust."

The one-minute clip featured cartoon animals, from bees to bald eagles, taking a knee while the national anthem hummed in the background. It closed on the hashtag “#EndSpeciesism.”

The media spot was an attempt, in PETA’s own words, to “pay homage to Colin Kaepernick and movements rejecting injustice,” but for many viewers, including those of color, the comparison struck an insulting chord. Michael Harriot, a columnist for The Root, called the ad a “despicable but expected” example of “mockery of 400 years of systemic oppression by comparing Black lives to grizzly bears and bald eagles.”"

No matter how strongly you feel about the rights of animals, it’s still so wrong to use images of other people's slavery to make your point.

"Lactose intolerance in infancy resulting from congenital lactase deficiency is a rare disorder. Its incidence is unknown. This condition is most common in Finland, where it affects an estimated 1 in 60,000 newborns.

Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, with 70 to 100 percent of people affected in these communities. Lactose intolerance is also very common in people of West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.

The prevalence of lactose intolerance is lowest in populations with a long history of dependence on unfermented milk products as an important food source. For example, only about 5 percent of people of Northern European descent are lactose intolerant."

"TAMPA, Fla. — More Black Americans are choosing plants. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 8% of African Americans identify as vegan or vegetarian compared to just 3% of the general population.

Many people of color say they switched to a plant-based diet for the environment, animal rights and their health.

Levi Tafari is the owner of The Good Life Food Truck in St. Petersburg. The business opened a little more than a year ago with a goal to veganize familiar foods. Tafari said he thinks more people of color are switching over to a plant-based diet because of the increase of information about nutrition currently available. “In this era, the age of information, I think people realize that it’s in the food we eat. It plays a role in our health.”"

"In general, plant-based diets are associated with reduced risks of numerous chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. However, more research is needed on the potential effects for Blacks living in the United States, who are disproportionately burdened with these conditions. The available evidence points to protection from heart disease and possibly cancer for Blacks who follow plant-based diets, but more research is needed for cardiovascular disease risk factors, cancer subtypes, and other chronic diseases. Future research in this area should utilize culturally appropriate methods to increase adherence in the implementation of plant-based diets in Black communities. Multi-level strategies will contribute to the long-term success of these efforts."

From the animals that become dog and cat food and the puppy farms churning out increasingly unhealthy purebred canines, to the goldfish sold by the bag and the crickets by the box, pet ownership is problematic because it denies animals the right of self-determination.

"Possible Uses for Marginal Land

Marginal land is not always unusable for human purposes. It can serve as grazing grounds for certain free-roaming livestock, for example. Some have suggested using marginal lands to produce biofuel since it could be used to produce biomass without pushing out traditional crops and competing with farmland. Plants that could be used for this purpose include switchgrass, shrub willow, and giant miscanthus.

Land that has been set aside for reasons other than productivity generally does not fall under the category of marginal land. Examples of this sort of land include state and national parks."
[675] https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/amazon-rainforest-now-appears-to-be-contributing-to-climate-change
"For years, researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures, drought, and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning. Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.

[...]

Regular flooding and dam-building releases the potent gas methane, as does cattle ranching, one chief reason forests are destroyed. And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon’s trees.

[...]

“Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake; that’s a problem,” says lead author Kristofer Covey, a professor of environmental studies at New York’s Skidmore College. “But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2, it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate.”"
[676] https://www.truthordrought.com/marginal-lands-myths
"The rest of that land could be returned to wild habitats performing invaluable ecosystem services. The study "Grazed and Confused?" written by an international team of experts and published by Food Climate Research Network, stated, "While ‘grassfed’ animals may not be dependent on arable-based feeds, the supposition that they are using spare land that could not be used for something else is mistaken... land that is used to graze animals could potentially be used for something else – for food, for nature conservation, for forests, or for bioenergy." 

This is echoed by former chief scientific adviser to the UK government Prof Sir Ian Boyd: “It would be much better to store carbon and water, grow trees and make the land available for people to improve their health and welfare.”"
[677] https://www.tabledebates.org/blog/marginal-lands-sustainable-food-systems-panacea-or-bunk-concept
"Furthermore, some argue that marginal grasslands should instead be used to provide ‘low-cost’ livestock feed to replace feed crops that compete with food for humans because they are grown on productive arable land. Livestock could freely graze on marginal grasslands that could not support arable production, turning inedible biomass into food."

"The pastures found in coastal areas of Iveragh and Pen Llŷn are very important to the chough, especially where they are well-drained and south facing. Pastures that are well-grazed by sheep and cattle suit the choughs’ foraging style, where they probe the soil with their curved red beaks. The presence of livestock can also increase the abundance of invertebrates & larvae that depend on dung."
[680] https://weeatbalanced.com/sustainability/how-livestock-farming-can-have-a-positive-impact-on-the-environment/
"Livestock grazing is crucial for encouraging and maintaining biodiversity. Without maintaining a low level of grazing across grasslands, species-rich grasslands are replaced by taller, wild grasslands with lower species diversity, often as a result of the presence of invasive species. This was demonstrated when agricultural subsidies transitioned to area payments, leaving much grassland unmanaged, and resulting in a sharp decrease in biodiversity."

However, less is known about the effect on other species and on the whole forest ecosystem,” said Li, assistant professor of environmental sciences at Duke Kunshan University and the study’s main author. “We analyzed existing evidence about livestock grazing on a large scale to lay the foundation for future research.”

Their results showed that livestock had a negative impact on forest structure, as well as leading to a reduced number of species and exacerbating climate change, but that outcomes were heavily influenced by other environmental factors."

Existing plant communities can include both native and introduced plants. Disturbed lands that have been revegetated naturally or artificially are included. Management of rangelands occurs primarily through ecological processes, rather than agronomic applications. Grazing, by both domestic livestock and wildlife, is the most common ecological management process, with fire and weather extremes also being significant ecological factors. Rangelands include grasslands, savannas, shrublands, most deserts, tundra, alpine communities, marshes and meadows."

"More than 80 per cent of almonds eaten around the world are grown in California. One of the biggest gripes about the high toll on California’s drought-stricken agriculture system is that two-thirds of the almonds grown are exported. This ‘virtual water’ gets shipped abroad.

Also, wildlife comes under threat when water levels reach dangerously low levels, as when the endangered king salmon in Northern California reportedly became imperilled by water being diverted to almond farms.

So, it was a big deal when we learned that it takes an entire gallon of water just to produce one almond. Ouch. Suddenly something long seen as a sign of a health-conscious eater was making shoppers think twice."

Breaking up meat's monopoly as the most thirsty food type is nuts, with 9,063 liters of water needed to produce the average kilo. Further down the scale are fruits and vegetables, requiring 962 and 322 liters per kilogram respectively. In terms of the most water-efficient way to consume calories, the best option from this list is cereals -one kilocalorie demanding 0.51 liters."
[687] https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/
"Per ton of product, animal products generally have a larger water footprint than crop products. The same is true when we look at the water footprint per calorie. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is twenty times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. When we look at the water requirements for protein, it has been found that the water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is about 1.5 times larger than for pulses. For beef, the water footprint per gram of protein is 6 times larger than for pulses. In the case of fat, butter has a relatively small water footprint per gram of fat, even lower than for oil crops. All other animal products, however, have larger water footprints per gram of fat when compared to oil crops. From a freshwater resource perspective, it is more efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop products than animal products."

"A vast amount of water is used to produce the food and products that nations consume. Large population is the greatest factor, but inefficient agriculture or dependence on water-intensive cuisine can exacerbate demand; meat consumption accounts for 30 percent of the U.S. water footprint."
[689] https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment
"Eat a steak or a chicken and you are effectively consuming the water that the animal has needed to live and grow. Vegetarian author John Robbins calculates it takes 60, 108, 168, and 229 pounds of water to produce one pound of potatoes, wheat, maize and rice respectively. But a pound of beef needs around 9,000 litres – or more than 20,000lbs of water. Equally, it takes nearly 1,000 litres of water to produce one litre of milk. A broiler chicken, by contrast, is far more efficient, producing the same amount of meat as a cow on just 1,500 litres.

Pigs are some of the thirstiest animals. An average-sized north American pig farm with 80,000 pigs needs nearly 75m gallons of fresh water a year. A large one, which might have one million or more pigs, may need as much as a city."

"Beef is extremely inefficient to produce, as cattle consume a huge amount of calories and protein in order to produce a relatively small amount of calories and protein for human consumption (sheep and goat are similarly inefficient converters of feed to food, but are eaten on a much smaller scale globally). As a result, beef production requires large quantities of land and water per unit of protein or calorie consumed.

One-quarter of the earth’s land (excluding Antarctica) is used as pastureland, and beef accounts for one-third of the global water footprint of farm animal production. Beef also has a disproportionate impact on climate change. Ruminants, of which cattle are the most common, accounted for nearly half of all agricultural production-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. If cattle were able to form their own nation, they would rank third behind China and the United States among the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters."

Extensive cattle ranching is the number one culprit of deforestation in virtually every Amazon country, and it accounts for 80% of current deforestation (Nepstad et al. 2008). Alone, the deforestation caused by cattle ranching is responsible for the release of 340 million tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year, equivalent to 3.4% of current global emissions."

"Seen in this light, the estimates of carrying capacity for each scenario suggest that dietary choices can greatly influence the ability of agriculture to meet human food needs. Reducing meat in the diet clearly resulted in increased carrying capacity, as evidenced by the fact that carrying capacity increased across the five healthy omnivorous diets as the amount of meat consumed decreased. Likewise, the ovolacto- and lacto-vegetarian diets had the highest estimates of carrying capacity overall."

"Farming can only be called sustainable if farmers can support their families. Fortunately, many of the approaches to improving farmer incomes improve the health of the Earth, too. Managing pests and weeds naturally, for example, reduces the need for harmful pesticides, thereby lowering costs. Planting fruit trees on farms can give farmers another product to sell, store carbon, and nourish soils.

Business has a crucial role to play in improving farmer incomes, too. Companies can help farmers with the upfront costs of adopting sustainable practices and pay more for crops that have been produced more sustainably."

"The vast majority of soya is grown in Argentina, Brazil and the US, which between them account for 80% of global production. Two of those countries – Argentina and Brazil – have serious risks of deforestation in soya production, and also provide most of the soya used by UK farmers. There is a small but growing supply of soya produced in Europe, but it is not yet competitive with producers in the Americas. It is currently more profitable for European farmers to grow alternative crops to soya. The main sources of organic soya are China, India, the US and Russia."

"Global agribusiness has for 30 years turned to tropical rainforests – not for their timber but for the land that can be used to graze cattle or grow palm oil and soya. Millions of hectares of trees have been felled to provide burgers for the US and more recently animal feed for farms for Europe, China and Japan.

In its latest food report What's Feeding Our Food? Friends of the Earth estimates that around 6m hectares of forest land a year – an area equivalent to Latvia or twice the size of Belgium – and a similar acreage of peat and wetlands elsewhere, is converted to farmland a year. Of that, it says, most goes to livestock or to grow the crops to feed the cattle.

As soya becomes the world's major crop for chicken feed, so the industry is driving cattle ranching deeper into the forests."

"Narrow crop rotations, particularly monoculture, often result in yield decreases (Power & Follett, 1987; Peterson & Varvel, 1989a, b, c). Long-term studies have shown that crop rotations with or without legumes are essential to maintain high production levels (Mitchell et al., 1991)."
[698] https://blogs.iu.edu/sustainthefuture/2014/02/06/monocropping/comment-page-1/
"Mono-crop farming is the practice of growing large amounts of one crop on the land. This practice was recognized as a very economical way to provide farmers with a way to earn money, grow large amounts of a staple crop, like soy, corn, or wheat, and sell these crops off to any company willing to use it for food or fuel.

The problem with this is that the destruction that is done to the environment when mono-cropping is being engaged is far greater than the benefits it brings. The depletion of the nutrients in the soil, the use of pesticides on the crops, and not the entire crop is used for food. This leaves land that is even more reliant on the pesticides to fight off predators which in return puts more chemicals into the system. Finally, the entire reason we grow food is to eat it. This type of farming does not provide the diversity needed in our diets or to our ecosystem."

"After eight years, such species-rich forest plots stored an average of 32 tons of carbon per hectare in aboveground biomass. By contrast, monocultures averaged only 12 tons of carbon per hectare -- less than half as much. During photosynthesis, the plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert the carbon to biomass. When a forest stores more carbon, this helps reduce greenhouse gases and at the same time also indicates high forest productivity."

"Nearly 40% of Earth’s surface is utilized for conventional animal feed production and other agricultural practices—the single largest land use on the planet (Barbieri et al, 2017). This cropland is a key driver of environmental health, as well as a leading factor in the decline of biodiversity and global food system resilience. In the past, traditional growing techniques like crop diversification and rotations worked in tandem to reduce environmental impact by “control[ling] nutrient and water balances, weed, pest and disease infestations and risk exposure, and to improv[ing] system resilience as well as to fulfill human and livestock food and feed needs” (Barbieri et al, 2017). However, modern monoculture processes, with the assistance of the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, have drastically simplified agriculture to prioritize high-yield production of feed grains."

"A team of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists has given growers in the Piedmont guidance on how to restore degraded soils and make the land productive. Researchers with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) found that if cattle are managed so that they graze moderately, soil quality can be restored and emissions of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) can be reduced.

ARS is USDA's principal intramural scientific research agency. The research, published in the Soil Science Society of America Journal, supports the USDA priority of responding to climate change. 

Cotton, soybean, sorghum and wheat are widely grown in the Piedmont, an area which stretches from Alabama to Virginia. But decades of plowing have degraded the soil and growers have slowly allowed much of the land to revert to forests and pastures, according to Alan Franzluebbers, an ecologist at the ARS J.

"Our results suggest that improved soil nutrient and grazing management of permanent pasture can lead to an increase of 500–700 kg C/ha.year where the initial SOC concentrations are well below steady-state concentrations that could be expected after long periods of improved management. No difference was found between perennial pasture and annual pasture to the depth measured (0–0.3 m). Our results suggest that pasture holds the key to maintaining, and even increasing, SOC under crop/pasture in this environment."

"What’s biochar? Basically, it’s organic matter that is burned slowly, with a restricted flow of oxygen, and then the fire is stopped when the material reaches the charcoal stage. Unlike tiny tidbits of ash, coarse lumps of charcoal are full of crevices and holes, which help them serve as life rafts to soil microorganisms. The carbon compounds in charcoal form loose chemical bonds with soluble plant nutrients so they are not as readily washed away by rain and irrigation. Biochar alone added to poor soil has little benefit to plants, but when used in combination with compost and organic fertilizers, it can dramatically improve plant growth while helping retain nutrients in the soil."

""No-till farming" sounds pretty dull at first. The term basically describes ways to grow crops each year without disturbing the soil through tillage or plowing.

But it's an important idea. Plowing and tillage are major sources of soil erosion around the world — they were key factors behind the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. What's more, churning up all that soil can release a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, helping to warm the planet. So, since the 1980s, more and more American farmers (and policymakers) have started taking no-till farming seriously."

"Eisenbach shows me his small plant on the edge of Kalamata where he makes what he calls biocyclic humus soil. There’s one small shed, two employees, and 12 long hummocks of black soil tended by a mini-tractor – a purpose-built Swiss composter. He first mixes grape pomace, olive leaves and olive cake. The temperature must be above 56C to kill harmful micro-organisms. For a month, the mini-tractor churns the compost like a whisk and adds water daily. For another three months, the compost is turned weekly to enter the first stage of “ripeness”.

“Even with a difficult raw material you can produce a fantastic ripe, balanced compost within five months,” says Eisenbach. “Everybody would say this is a ripe compost. But it is not a ripe compost.” As he accidentally discovered, extra benefits occur when this compost is left to mature for up to four years. In one row of maturing compost, Eisenbach is growing vegetables directly into the humus soil."

"In fact, as a recent study by agronomists from the Department of Agriculture, Iowa State University and the University of Minnesota shows, there’s nothing obsolete about four-crop rotation. It produces the same yields, it sharply reduces the toxicity of freshwater runoff, and it eliminates many of the problems associated with genetically modified crops, including the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds. It’s also simply better for the soil. A four-crop rotation using conventional crop varieties, along with much lower applications of fertilizer and herbicides and some animal manure, works every bit as well as the prevailing monotony of corn and soybeans."
[711] https://cropwatch.unl.edu/tillage/residue
"Crop residue absorbs raindrop impact and keeps the wind off the soil surface.

- This reduces soil particle detachment, reducing erosion from the forces of water and wind.
- By protecting the soil surface, surface crusting is also reduced, improving infiltration and decreasing runoff.
- This effect conserves soil and water and reduces risks to the environment.
- The residue mulch further conserves water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface.
- The decaying residue feeds soil microbes and earthworms, cycling the nutrients and building soil structure."

"There is no patent on this humus soil, so why is it not ubiquitous? “Agro-terrorism,” grimaces Bilalis. He argues that big chemical corporations hinder simpler solutions that are better for people, crops and wildlife. “It’s very difficult to penetrate the market because the barriers come from big companies. Unfortunately the food we serve in big cities is industrial food – the fruit has to be the same size, the same colour, like cars.”

But there is also a catch. Doesn’t the four years it takes to turn good compost into humus soil make it too expensive for large-scale use? Eisenbach anticipates demand for (expensive) mature humus soil from small-scale urban growers who can cultivate vegetables in rooftop soil bags. But he hopes that conventional organic farmers in his network will buy it as affordable “ripe compost” and ripen it on their land. While letting it mature into humus soil, they can grow vegetables in it, so land is not wasted."

"Overgrazing

The conversion of natural ecosystems to pasture land doesn’t damage the land initially as much as crop production, but this change in usage can lead to high rates of erosion and loss of topsoil and nutrients. Overgrazing can reduce ground cover, enabling erosion and compaction of the land by wind and rain.. [sic] This reduces the ability for plants to grow and water to penetrate, which harms soil microbes and results in serious erosion of the land."

"How Do You Restore Degraded Soil?

A degraded soil typically loses its ability to supply food and habitation to living organisms, in its surrounding. When this happens, effort is made to restore the soil back to its natural state. Characteristics of a degraded soil include: high salinity, decline in fertility, decline in organic matter (leading to decline in soil structure), soil erodibility, increase in alkalinity and acidity."

"Q: Is today’s food less nutritious than it was in the past because agricultural soil is being depleted of minerals?

A. Several studies of fruits, vegetables and grains have suggested a decline in nutritional value over time, but the reasons may not be as simple as soil depletion. There is considerable evidence that such problems may be related to changes in cultivated varieties, with some high-yielding plants being less nutritious than historical varieties. Several other issues are involved, like changes in farming methods, including the extensive use of chemical fertilizers, as well as food processing and preparation. A 2004 study evaluated Department of Agriculture data for 43 garden crops from 1950 to 1999. The researchers found statistically reliable declines for six nutrients — protein, calcium, potassium, iron and vitamins B2 and C — but no change for seven others."

"Approximately 31 percent of food produced in the U.S., or 133 billion pounds of food worth $162 billion, was wasted in 2011 according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that the type of food wasted has a significant impact on the environment. Although less meat is wasted (on average) compared to fruits and vegetables, the researchers found that significantly more energy is used in the production of meat compared to the production of vegetables. This wasted energy is usually in the form of resources that can have negative impacts on the surrounding environment, such as diesel fuel or fertilizer being released into the environment."

"Livestock farming incurs large and varied environmental burdens, dominated by beef. Replacing beef with resource efficient alternatives is thus potentially beneficial, but may conflict with nutritional considerations. Here we show that protein-equivalent plant based alternatives to the beef portion of the mean American diet are readily devisible, and offer mostly improved nutritional profile considering the full lipid profile, key vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients. We then show that replacement diets require on average only 10% of land, 4% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 6% of reactive nitrogen (Nr) compared to what the replaced beef diet requires. Applied to 320 million Americans, the beef-to-plant shift can save 91 million cropland acres (and 770 million rangeland acres), 278 million metric ton CO2e, and 3.7 million metric ton Nr annually.

[733] https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/deforestation.php
"Deforestation follows a fairly predictable pattern in these images. The first clearings that appear in the forest are in a fishbone pattern, arrayed along the edges of roads. Over time, the fishbones collapse into a mixture of forest remnants, cleared areas, and settlements. This pattern follows one of the most common deforestation trajectories in the Amazon. Legal and illegal roads penetrate a remote part of the forest, and small farmers migrate to the area. They claim land along the road and clear some of it for crops. Within a few years, heavy rains and erosion deplete the soil, and crop yields fall. Farmers then convert the degraded land to cattle pasture, and clear more forest for crops. Eventually the small land holders, having cleared much of their land, sell it or abandon it to large cattle holders, who consolidate the plots into large areas of pasture."

"It is increasingly commonly suggested that grasslands are a perpetual sink for carbon, and that just maintaining grasslands will yield a net carbon sink. I examine the evidence for this from repeated soil surveys, long term grassland experiments and simple mass balance calculations. I conclude that it is untenable that grasslands act as a perpetual carbon sink, and the most likely explanation for observed grassland carbon sinks over short periods is legacy effects of land use and land management prior to the beginning of flux measurement periods. Simply having grassland does not result is a carbon sink, but judicious management or previously poorly managed grasslands can increase the sink capacity. Given that grasslands are a large store of carbon, and that it is easier and faster for soils to lose carbon that it is for them to gain carbon, it is an important management target to maintain these stocks."

Furthermore, as emissions from cultured meat are predominantly composed of CO2, their warming legacy persists even if production declines or ceases (in the absence of active removal of this CO2 from the atmosphere). Replacing cattle systems with cultured meat production before energy generation is sufficiently decarbonized and/or the more optimistic production footprints presented here are realized (assuming they can be), could risk a long-term, negative climate impact."

In particular, the V approach was not associated with significantly lower environmental footprints when compared to VG one. A likely explanation might be that, while unprocessed plant-based foodstuffs usually replace animal-based products in hypothetical vegetarian and vegan diets, the real plant-based diets are instead characterised by industrially highly-processed plant-based meat and dairy substitutes (e.g. seitan burger and soy yoghurt). Some people opt for highly processed, high-fat products instead of nutritious plant-based foodstuffs. Moreover, the lower energy density of plant-based foodstuffs results in a higher food intake for V with respect to VG (around 12.5% in terms of food weight), possibly explaining the lack of environmental benefits of a vegan diet in comparison with an ovo-lacto-vegetarian choice."

These chemicals, many of which were developed in the lab and are petroleum-based, have allowed farmers and gardeners of every stripe to exercise greater control over the plants they want to grow by enriching the immediate environment and warding off pests. But such benefits haven’t come without environmental costs—namely the wholesale pollution of most of our streams, rivers, ponds, lakes and even coastal areas, as these synthetic chemicals run-off into the nearby waterways."

"A landmark study conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison has shown manure to provide better results in terms of crop yield and soil quality compared to the use of inorganic fertilizers.

The study, Response of Soil Organic Carbon, pH, Electrical Conductivity, and Water Stable Aggregates to Long-Term Annual Manure and Inorganic Fertilizer, was recently published in Soil Science Society of America Journal.

The results of this study could further bolster the growing movement toward utilizing manure more effectively."

"Phosphorus also harms the environment. Excessive fertiliser use means it leaches from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea, leading to so-called dead zones where most fish can’t survive. Uninhibited algae growth caused by high levels of phosphorus in water has already created more than 400 coastal death zones worldwide. Related human poisoning costs US$2.2 billion dollars annually in the US alone."

"Phosphorus plays a vital role in the world’s food production; it is a mineral that is a key ingredient in most fertilizers and is found predominantly in the form of phosphate rock. In order to keep up with the demand of crops that must be grown for our planets ever-increasing population, phosphate use has quadrupled in the last 50 years.

Most countries do not have their own phosphate supplies, the majority is exported from Morocco, a country experiencing increasing political unrest. It is feared that phosphate is currently being mined unsustainably, while reserves could potentially sustain the worlds needs for centuries, it is finite and new sources are unlikely to be discovered."

"It’s not correct to call faeces ‘human waste’, Jenkins says. “A compost toilet is a waste-free toilet system; there is no waste involved.” What comes out goes back in, to be reused as fertiliser on his land – Jenkins grows corn, onions, parsley, sweet peppers, hot peppers, broccoli, courgettes, winter squash, beetroots, blueberries, and raspberries. He has apple trees, peach trees, pear trees. He keeps chickens and he keeps ducks. "I have the whole nine yards going on here," he says."

"The crux of SnapPlus calculates nutrient requirements for croplands and pastures. The phosphorus calculation starts with a soil test, adds phosphorus from planned fertilizer and manure applications, then subtracts phosphorus extracted by crops. The software also estimates field erosion and phosphorus runoff rates to streams and lakes.

[...]

With its triple benefit of avoiding pollution, supporting yields and reducing costs, SnapPlus “is a good use of taxpayer dollars,” Hiemstra says. “You can call the county and get support, if they can’t answer, there is a full staff in Madison. The people who are writing the program are the ones telling you how to use it, and answering your questions.”"

"At worst, chemical fertilizers may increase the risks of developing cancer in adults and children and adversely affecting fetal brain development. This is not news to scientists. A 1994 study by the University of Wisconsin suggest show that typical concentrations of nitrate (a common fertilizer) and a pesticide in the groundwater may compromise the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of young children and developing fetuses. A study in 1973 associates high levels of sodium nitrate in groundwater with the prevalence of gastric cancer, and another one in 1996 with that of testicular cancer."

"Despite their benefits, a continuous release of antibiotics into the environment and their potential adverse impact on living organisms is of great concern [...] Because the majority of antibiotics are not completely metabolized in the bodies of humans and animals, a high percentage of administered drugs is discharged into water and soil through municipal wastewater, animal manure, sewage sludge, and biosolids (nutrient-rich organic materials resulting from the treatment of sewage) that are frequently used to irrigate and fertilize agricultural lands 

[...]

Even very low concentrations of antibiotics in the soil [below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)], creates conditions for genetic changes in bacterial genomes and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids, transposons, and genomic islands, between and among microbial populations"

"What happens upstream in a river, affects everyone who uses the water downstream from plants, fish, birds, and animals, to people who use the water for irrigation and recreation. A polluted headwater affects fish species like trout that use streams and rivers for nesting. If silt and soil are washed into a stream, the eggs of the trout will be covered and will die. Nutrient runoff from cattle manure also affects water quality. Nutrient runoff in streams affects the types of plants that grow there. A body of water with high nutrient levels will encourage the growth of weeds, choking out native water plants and fish. Water with high nutrient levels will also encourage plankton blooms that deplete the water in ponds and lakes of oxygen that fish need to breath."

"How rotational grazing works

Rotational grazing works on the basic principle of ‘graze and rest’, so once a paddock is grazed, it is allowed to undergo a rest period to rejuvenate the leaves for the next grazing. This leads to higher yield, with research suggesting around 20% more grass is grown in a rotational grazing system. This, combined with the correct allocation of grass to stock class, results in more grass being utilised, which means more grass to convert into beef."

"Mitigating ES trade-offs requires knowledge of how different man-agement options affect target ESs. Currently, rangeland managers debate whether grazing rotation—an option commonly used to manage cattle disturbance—can alleviate trade-offs between livestock production and conservation outcomes (Briske et al., 2008; Lagendijk et al., 2017; Roche et al., 2015; Teague et al., 2013). Our results suggest that rotation can provide cleaner water in rangelands, but to be most helpful for mitigating ES trade-offs, management strategies need to move beyond broadly defined grazing systems that conflate different rotational management practices (Briske et al., 2011)."

"What about water pollution?

So far, it’s the impact of manure on waterways that has received the most attention. This either occurs through accidental spillages, flooding or farmers deliberately dumping excess waste into rivers. Investigations have found that the latter practice is still commonplace, despite being illegal in many countries.

The ecological consequences are typically drastic, with the high levels of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates in manure leading to the spread of waterborne pathogens, and the growth of harmful algal blooms. The latter can poison wildlife by releasing deadly neurotoxins, and if they become widespread in fresh and marine water, they can end up getting into the food chain and being consumed by humans."

"The hazards to human health represented by zoonotic pathogens in animal excreta remain poorly understood and inadequately addressed in the literature. These hazards present special challenges for authorities charged with maintaining the quality of surface waters used for recreation and as sources of drinking-water.

Human faeces are frequently treated and may be disinfected before they are discharged into surface waters, whereas non-human faecal contamination is commonly neither treated nor disinfected"

"In regenerative agriculture (focusing on soil health) farmers move livestock to replicate the grazing patterns of native ungulates and achieve all three benefits.

For a farmer, the real resource is the soil, not the crops. Healthy soil means fewer inputs like fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide and fungicide are necessary to keep yields high. Healthy soil is more permeable, and allows rainwater to infiltrate. Healthy soil stores more water that is available for plants in times of drought. It infiltrates more water during wet times, meaning less runoff or standing water in fields.

[...]

But there is a revival of more traditional farming practices, one that improves soil health, builds topsoil, reduces runoff, provides a more stable income for small farmers, draws carbon from the atmosphere and sequesters it in the soil, and treats animals humanely. It is broadly known as regenerative agriculture, and will be key to meeting Minnesota’s water quality goals."

"Imagine turning on your faucet for a glass of water only to find out that the water wasn’t suitable for drinking. This sounds like a scenario from the past or in some far off country and not on our doorsteps, but it is happening right here in America. A new report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) shows that there is a growing epidemic of toxic algal blooms that are polluting lakes and other waterways, and these are making our water unfit for human consumption.

[...]

One of the biggest culprits contributing to toxic algal blooms is run-off from agricultural fields and cow pastures, getting into large bodies of water near urban areas. We can talk about not polluting our local water supplies, but that’s pretty much a given. A longer-term impact can be made by reducing our meat and dairy intake."

"Everything we do, from the food we eat, products we buy to the way we travel, releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and so has an impact on the planet’s climate. But some activities have a far greater impact than others.

Around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation. Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.

At first glance, that might not seem like very big contribution. Except, only a very small percentage of the world flies frequently. Even in richer countries like the UK and the US, around half of people fly in any given year, and just 12-15% are frequent fliers."

The top 20 companies on the list have contributed to 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane worldwide, totalling 480bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) since 1965.
