Discussion Name:
Have authoritarian governments handled COVID-19 better than others?

1. Thesis:
Authoritarian governments have handled COVID-19 better than others.

  1.1. Con:
  Many democracies have handled COVID-19 well.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Many democracies have pursued authoritarian policies, such as vaccine mandates [1], in order to handle the pandemic well.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      110 countries [2] globally have declared states of emergency. This can provide governments with authoritarian powers [3].

        1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
        On 30 March 2021, the Hungarian Parliament passed the Coronavirus Act [4], which indefinitely granted the government emergency powers.

          1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
          The Hungarian Parliament subsequently voted [5] to repeal these powers.

            1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Orban's government developed a new law [6] to keep most of the powers from the Coronavirus Act.

          1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
          The bill passed by 137 to 53 [7] in the Hungarian Parliament, clearly demonstrating majority support for the measures.

        1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
        Some governments have historically used emergency legislation to erode civil liberties for a long time after a crisis.

          1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
          Northern Ireland used a modified version of World War I emergency legislation [8] to oppress minorities for decades after the war.

      1.1.1.2. Pro:
      Many democratic countries imposed curfews [9] on citizens in order to control the spread of the virus, this process is inherently authoritarian [10].

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      If such policies were pursued by a democratically-elected government during a time of crisis, then they cannot be said to be truly authoritarian.

        1.1.1.3.1. Con:
        If the effects of the action are oppressive, such as the limiting of free movement, speech or gathering, then who is causing them is irrelevant.

          1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
          The intention behind the action is always relevant. If a democratically elected government takes a temporary action with the intent of minimizing harm and protecting people, then that is different to an authoritarian state exercising control.

        1.1.1.3.2. Pro:
        A democratically elected government has a mandate to act and govern on behalf of the people. Taking strong action to preserve the life of such people is not an authoritarian action.

      1.1.1.4. Con:
      These authoritarian measures can have high levels of public support. 80% [11] of the British public supported restrictions on their freedom in January.

        1.1.1.4.1. Con:
        This suggests that 20% of people had their rights restricted against their will. Just because something has public support does not mean that it is morally correct or acceptable.

    1.1.2. Con:
    Many EU democracies have suffered from a loss in citizen trust [12] following the COVID-19 pandemic.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      Such a fall in citizen trust does not happen in a vacuum. There are significant factors other than government response to COVID-19 that may be causing this.

        1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
        Bad-faith politics and misrepresentation during Brexit has undermined representative democracy [13] for all parties involved.

        1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
        The EU has failed to utilise its soft power in order to promote democracy at home and abroad [14].

          1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          Both Poland and Hungary have come under investigation for undermining democracy and oppressing minority groups [15], however the EU has been unable to sanction them [16].

        1.1.2.1.3. Con:
        The European Council on Foreign Relations [17] believes that COVID-19 and vaccine procurement are mainly to blame for decreasing citizen trust.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Trust in national governments decreased, whereas trust in the EU has steadily increased [18]. This shows greater citizen support for less democratic, more authoritarian [19] institutions during COVID.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    New Zealand [20] has been highly successful in tackling COVID-19.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      The democratic government of New Zealand took decisive action through the adoption of a zero-COVID [21] strategy.

        1.1.3.1.1. Con:
        New Zealand has since abandoned its zero-Covid strategy [22].

          1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
          This was not due to a failure of governance or policy making, but rather the development of the Delta variant [23].

          1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro:
          Some analysts [24] believe this strategy will always be unsustainable as every new case results in another snap lockdown.

        1.1.3.1.2. Con:
        The promise of zero-COVID resulted in few people getting vaccinated [25] in New Zealand.

          1.1.3.1.2.1. Con:
          During the implementation of zero-COVID policy there was little reason to get vaccinated, considering how small the chance of contracting the virus was. Now that this has changed, vaccination rates will rise.

            1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            72% [26] of the population of New Zealand is now fully vaccinated.

        1.1.3.1.3. Pro:
        This policy has allowed the people of New Zealand to live in relative normality [27] for most of the pandemic.

        1.1.3.1.4. Pro:
        New Zealand's death rate from COVID-19, as of October 2021, was only 27 people [28].

      1.1.3.2. Con:
      New Zealand is an island nation [29]. It is not reasonable to compare their performance to other countries with very different controls on their borders.

        1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
        Island nations were seen to have considerably more success [30] at mitigating the impact of COVID-19.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    Many democracies have performed better [31] than authoritarian states in encouraging citizen cooperation, as political repression limits the desire for cooperation [32].

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      Large-scale protests [33] against COVID restrictions have engulfed China, indicating public dissatisfaction with their authoritarian government.

    1.1.5. Con:
    The United States of America, which considers itself the world's leading democracy [34], failed in its response to COVID-19 [35].

      1.1.5.1. Pro:
      Donald Trump promoted dangerous COVID-19 pseudoscience [36].

      1.1.5.2. Con:
      The US' COVID-19 response has varied from state to state [37].

      1.1.5.3. Con:
      Few people inside and outside the US consider the country as a good example for democracy anymore, according to a 2021 survey [38]. Therefore, the American response to Covid can hardly be seen as an indicator for how democracies are performing.

      1.1.5.4. Pro:
      The United States failed to be a global leader in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        1.1.5.4.1. Pro:
        The United States is guilty of pursuing a policy of vaccine nationalism [39], rather than the equitable distribution [40] of resources internationally.

        1.1.5.4.2. Con:
        The United States is the largest [41] single contributor to the UN'S COVAX program.

          1.1.5.4.2.1. Con:
          Sweden, despite lacking the US' economic firepower, donated more resources per capita [42].

      1.1.5.5. Con:
      The US was only ranked 25th [43] in the 2020 Democracy Index. According to this index, the US is a "Flawed democracy".

        1.1.5.5.1. Pro:
        Donald Trump was an autocratic leader [44]. Given that he oversaw much of the country's pandemic response, the US' performance should not be considered representative of how democracies respond to emergencies.

      1.1.5.6. Pro:
      As of March 2021, the US had 20% of global COVID-19 deaths [45] despite only having 4% of the global population.

        1.1.5.6.1. Con:
        As of late 2021, the US ranked 20th [46] in terms of Covid deaths per capita and behind several other democratic nations from Europe as well as South America. This contextualizes the American performance during the pandemic.

  1.2. Con:
  The social, political and economic cost of COVID-19 measures for people in authoritarian states is too high.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    Authoritarian state responses to emergencies are only positive when the state has good intention [47]s and acts wisely, which they commonly do not. In these cases, course correction is unlikely and citizens are likely to be deceived.

      1.2.1.1. Pro:
      It is highly unlikely that a state would have malintent when it comes to COVID-19. The disease effects all in society, and it is in the best interests of everyone if it is stopped.

        1.2.1.1.1. Con:
        While most authoritarian states may wish to reduce the impact of COVID-19, that does not mean they will not use the pandemic as a cover [48] to grab additional powers at their citizens' expense.

    1.2.2. Pro:
    Public health in western developed countries has been negatively impacted by authoritarian COVID-19 responses.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      The developed world has seen less healthy eating habits [49].

      1.2.2.2. Pro:
      The UK will likely have 10,000 additional cancer deaths from delayed diagnosis [50].

      1.2.2.3. Con:
      Lockdowns have saved lives [51].

    1.2.3. Con:
    Authoritarian states already limit social, political and economic freedoms by nature. If further control saves lives, then the cost is not too high.

      1.2.3.1. Pro:
      It is likely that a population that is used to having their rights curtailed will not find further restrictions with good cause offensive.

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      The imposition of strong limits to fundamental freedoms like movement and gathering may be the straw that breaks the camel's back in authoritarian societies.

    1.2.4. Con:
    People all over the world are willing to give up their rights for physical safety.

      1.2.4.1. Con:
      Anti-lockdown protests [52] have erupted all over the world.

      1.2.4.2. Pro:
      A USA Today poll found that most Americans believe that protecting the public from COVID-19 is more important [53] than individual liberty.

  1.3. Con:
  Many authoritarian states lack a healthy private sector, a core requirement of any effective COVID-19 strategy.

    1.3.1. Con:
    The private sector has refused to donate essential items to governments during COVID-19.

      1.3.1.1. Pro:
      The private sector is a distinct entity from the government; as such, it should not have a mandate to provide goods or services free of charge.

      1.3.1.2. Con:
      The private sector has provided financial donations [54] to the UN's COVAX [55] program.

    1.3.2. Con:
    Over reliance on private healthcare has induced crises [56] in the healthcare systems of many low-middle income countries due to the pressure of COVID-19.

      1.3.2.1. Pro:
      Many private sector healthcare systems rely on elective procedures. When governments cancelled these procedures due to COVID-19, some companies engaged in unethical business practices [57] to avoid bankruptcy.

    1.3.3. Pro:
    The private sector could provide essential health services [58] while the state healthcare system focuses on combatting COVID-19.

      1.3.3.1. Con:
      The outsourcing of public health services to private companies could be a covert method of privatising public healthcare.

        1.3.3.1.1. Pro:
        The British Medical Association has accused the British government of accelerating the privatisation of the NHS [59] by outsourcing prominent aspects of the state's COVID-19 response.

      1.3.3.2. Con:
      Government attempts to pay private healthcare companies to reduce pressure on public healthcare have failed.

        1.3.3.2.1. Pro:
        Despite being paid billions of pounds to take pressure off the NHS, private healthcare companies in England only saw eight COVID-19 patients a day [60] during the pandemic.

        1.3.3.2.2. Con:
        Any alleviation of pressure on public healthcare is a success given the novelty of these agreements and the COVID-19 crisis.

      1.3.3.3. Pro:
      The Irish government reached an agreement to co-opt private [61] healthcare capacity in order to bolster the public sector.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    The private sector has developed some of the essential tools for fighting COVID-19.

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      Private companies make COVID-19 lateral flow tests [62].

        1.3.4.1.1. Con:
        It is unclear how effective [63] lateral flow tests are.

        1.3.4.1.2. Pro:
        Most governments cannot make enough lateral flow tests for their citizens to take them twice a week (as they do in England [64]). The private sector was essential to their production.

      1.3.4.2. Pro:
      The Pfizer-BioNTech [65] vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca [66] vaccine were both developed by private companies.

        1.3.4.2.1. Pro:
        The Russian state has been accused of stealing [67] data from AstraZeneca in order to develop its own vaccine.

          1.3.4.2.1.1. Con:
          Russia has vehemently denied [68] these allegations.

        1.3.4.2.2. Con:
        97% of the funding for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine came from taxpayers or charitable trusts [69].

  1.4. Pro:
  Several authoritarian states seem to have control over the COVID-19 pandemic.

    1.4.1. Con:
    COVID-19 data from authoritarian states is unreliable.

      1.4.1.1. Pro:
      Citizens and healthcare workers in authoritarian states are less likely to blow the whistle or report mistakes for fear of punishment.

        1.4.1.1.1. Pro:
        The whistleblower Li Wenliang, one of the first Chinese doctors to raise the alarm about potential COVID-19 cases, was humiliated by the Wuhan government [70].

          1.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
          These were the acts of corrupt local government, and the Chinese Communist Party's top disciplinary exonerated the doctor and criticized local officials [71].

          1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro:
          Dr. Wenliang was reprimanded by police and forced to sign a confession [72].

        1.4.1.1.2. Con:
        Whistleblowers in democracies are often poorly treated.

          1.4.1.1.2.1. Con:
          Many democracies have laws in place protecting whistleblowers from mistreatment.

            1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
            In Ireland, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 [73] incentivises workers to disclose wrongdoings internally, but permits workers to make reports elsewhere, such as the media or government.

            1.4.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
            The EU has issued a directive [74] aimed at protecting whistleblowers and guaranteeing safe reporting channels and safeguards against retaliation. [75]

            1.4.1.1.2.1.3. Con:
            Laws require willing and able administrators to be effective. These are missing in some democracies.

              1.4.1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
              The Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered in October 2017. Her revelations on corruption directly implicated the Maltese prime minister and two of his closest aides [76]. The people who ordered her murder have never been brought to justice.

          1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro:
          CIA officials in the Trump administration discussed assassinating [77] Julian Assange.

            1.4.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
            Trump acted like an autocrat [78] on many occasions. His behaviour cannot be taken to represent the actions of a truly democratic government.

          1.4.1.1.2.3. Pro:
          Chelsea Manning served seven years of a 35-year sentence [79] for leaking public interest documents which major international news outlets subsequently reported on [80]. She was later rearrested, released, and arrested again [81].

      1.4.1.2. Pro:
      Authoritarian states may manipulate COVID-19 data purposefully in order to appear to have handled the pandemic more proficiently.

        1.4.1.2.1. Con:
        It is within the interests of authoritarian governments to appear honest and transparent in the case of COVID-19, as any misinformation could be easily questioned by the populace.

          1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro:
          North Korea has communicated that it is having issues with COVID-19. Kim Jong-Un has publically declared a state of emergency [82] and warned of a "grave incident" which has caused a "huge crisis" [83].

          1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          COVID-19 puts a lot of pressure on health services. If these began to fail or slow down due to COVID-19 cases while the government was claiming that the situation was normal, then the misinformation would become obvious.

        1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
        Virtually all analysts consider North Korea's claim that there are no cases to be impossible [84].

    1.4.2. Pro:
    North Korea claims to have no COVID-19 [85] cases.

      1.4.2.1. Con:
      The authoritarian steps taken to limit COVID-19, like harsh lockdown measures, have lead to increased hunger and risks of famine [86].

      1.4.2.2. Pro:
      North Korea closed its borders with China and Russia incredibly early [87], effectively protecting the country from COVID-19.

      1.4.2.3. Pro:
      North Korea enforces its COVID-19 restrictions very heavily, including executing [88] those who defy the laws and issuing a shoot-to-kill order to border guards [89].

      1.4.2.4. Con:
      -> See 1.4.1.2.2.

      1.4.2.5. Con:
      There are indirect signs that North Korea is dealing with a significant crisis, likely COVID-19.

        1.4.2.5.1. Pro:
        Only 700 North Koreans are being tested for COVID-19 each week [90]. It is more likely that no cases have been officially reported, or the Kim regime is suppressing information.

          1.4.2.5.1.1. Pro:
          Many NGOs, humanitarian groups and diplomats have left the country during the pandemic [91], making it difficult to learn what is happening in North Korea.

        1.4.2.5.2. Pro:
        Russia has had to offer North Korea large numbers of COVID-19 vaccines [92] in order to improve the situation in the country.

        1.4.2.5.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.1.2.1.1.

    1.4.3. Pro:
    China has largely beaten COVID-19 [93].

      1.4.3.1. Pro:
      As of October 2021, China has had approximately 125,000 [94] cases of COVID-19 despite having a population of 1.4 billion [95].

        1.4.3.1.1. Pro:
        The UK has had more COVID-19 deaths [96] than China has had Covid-19 cases, despite china having over 2100% [97] of the population of the UK.

        1.4.3.1.2. Con:
        China may have been under-reporting their COVID-19 statistics. Excess deaths in Wuhan [98], for example, are much higher than official COVID-19 statistics.

      1.4.3.2. Pro:
      Massive state control in China allowed for bold public health initiatives to be undertaken at very short notice.

        1.4.3.2.1. Pro:
        In Hebei province, construction started on new quarantine villages the morning after [99] the Chinese government decided to build them.

        1.4.3.2.2. Con:
        Fear of political reprisals [100] in Wuhan prevented officials from reporting the new virus to the central government in late 2019, slowing down China’s response to the virus at the start of the pandemic.

      1.4.3.3. Con:
      China is still enforcing lockdowns [101] and school closures [102].

      1.4.3.4. Con:
      China is not truly authoritarian [103].

        1.4.3.4.1. Con:
        China is a truly authoritarian state [104], as it does not allow freedom of thought or action, places power in the hands of an undemocratic government and does not allow for political competition.

        1.4.3.4.2. Pro:
        According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, China is not [105] one of the 21 most authoritarian states in the world.

          1.4.3.4.2.1. Con:
          The Democracy Matrix, an index of authoritarian states, claims that China is a "Hard Autocracy [106]" and the fifth-worst country globally in terms of quality of democracy.

      1.4.3.5. Con:
      China's success is not due to its authoritarian nature.

        1.4.3.5.1. Pro:
        China's experience with SARS [107] in 2002 laid the groundwork for its response to COVID-19 in 2019.

    1.4.4. Con:
    Rankings like the Bloomberg Covid Resilience Index [108] show several authoritarian countries at the bottom, such as Russia, Thailand and Vietnam. One can therefore hardly generalize about the performance of authoritarian countries.

      1.4.4.1. Con:
      The other way around, countries like Ireland, Chile, Canada and Finland at the top of the index show that democratic countries are among those that deal the best with Covid.

  1.5. Pro:
  Citizens in authoritarian states are more likely to follow COVID-19 guidelines.

    1.5.1. Pro:
    Adherence to restrictions [109] in democracies were hindered by the perceived inconsistencies in their application.

    1.5.2. Con:
    Ideology is unimportant in citizen adherence, it is more important that the state is perceived as trustworthy, legitimate and fair. [110]

      1.5.2.1. Con:
      Creating the perception that a ruling party is trustworthy, legitimate and fair is easier in an authoritarian regime, as governments may have control of the media or strong propaganda departments.

    1.5.3. Pro:
    Citizens in authoritarian states are seen to be more obedient [111] to state legislation.

      1.5.3.1. Con:
      Just because they are perceived to be more obedient does not mean that they are.

        1.5.3.1.1. Pro:
        North Korea has large amounts of smuggling activity [112], despite being a reclusive authoritarian state.

        1.5.3.1.2. Pro:
        China has investigated and dealt with hundreds of organised crime organisations [113] that have existed and grown despite the authoritarian regime.

    1.5.4. Con:
    Citizens in authoritarian states are less likely [114] to follow their government's travel guidelines.

    1.5.5. Con:
    -> See 1.4.1.1.

  1.6. Pro:
  Authoritarian control over state machinery allows for effective reactions to emergencies like COVID-19.

    1.6.1. Con:
    Efficacy should not come at the cost of civil liberties, given it is possible to achieve both [115] at once.

      1.6.1.1. Con:
      There is no point in preserving civil liberties if citizens are not alive and well enough to enjoy them.

        1.6.1.1.1. Pro:
        We already limit civil liberties when they can cause serious harm. When there is a deadly disease in circulation it is only reasonable that more civil liberties will be curtailed while the disease circulates.

        There is no point in being alive and well if you cannot enjoy personal freedoms and must live under constant government control.

      1.6.1.2. Pro:
      The potential threats to civil liberties are hard to predict. As such, initiating processes which compromise liberty can lead to disastrous outcomes. [116]

    1.6.2. Con:
    Temporary authoritarian control and authoritarian states are not equivalent. In democracies, politicians are held accountable [117] around the use of temporary authoritarian controls.

    1.6.3. Pro:
    Authoritarian use of digital tools has allowed for better management of the pandemic.

      1.6.3.1. Pro:
      China has developed a health code system which is capable of reporting location data to police and enforcing self-quarantines [118].

      These tools have come at the cost of personal privacy.

        1.6.3.2.1. Pro:
        South Korea's COVID-19 contact tracing program [119] has led to the leaking of private information to community members.

    1.6.4. Pro:
    -> See 1.1.1.

"Trump’s ambivalence unsettled politicians in European capitals, where the events in Hong Kong were being closely watched. Not only was the supposed leader of the free world giving Beijing what seemed like a green light, but, in doing so, he was raising pressure on the European Union and its member states—which had remained silent for weeks—to make their own views clear. Europe felt that it had to step into the breach and take a stand on democracy.

Still, it took the EU nearly two weeks to put out a brief statement. And it was far from strong, urging both sides in the Hong Kong conflict to exercise restraint. For the protesters, it was cold comfort.

"New Zealand is one of the few places in the world where that’s not the case. The country eliminated Covid 19 in the community by shutting its border in mid-March 2020, introducing compulsory quarantine for all returnees, and instituting a series of lockdowns to stamp out existing clusters. Every so often, a case slips through the border, causing a small outbreak. But without community transmission in the background, New Zealand can drill down into individual cases with forensic detail."
[21] https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-covid-19-pandemic-how-new-zealand-got-the-response-right/
"It has been argued that New Zealand’s isolated location spared the country from the worst. But statistics suggest otherwise. In 2019 New Zealand recorded 3.9 million visitor arrivals. On 19 March 2020, after 28 Covid cases had been recorded, the government closed the country’s borders to all but New Zealand citizens and permanent residents.

Over the next two months, a further 1433 caught the virus, and 22 died. The government decided to 'go hard and go early'. New Zealand was the only Western country to switch from the ‘flatten the curve’ suppression strategy adopted by most governments to a strategy of complete elimination of community transmission."
[22] https://www.wired.co.uk/article/new-zealand-zero-covid
"As other countries suffered mass infection and death, New Zealand was held up as a beacon of success for keeping Sars-CoV-2 at bay. In total, the country has recorded just 27 deaths due to Covid-19; the UK has almost 140,000. If we had the proportionate amount of deaths to New Zealand’s number, the nation’s death count would shrink to about 300, says Neil Pearce, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 

But Delta has hit New Zealand. On October 4, prime minister Jacinda Ardern unveiled that the country would be moving away from its elimination strategy, as it became clear that its battle with the Delta variant, with the first case found on August 17, was not ending anytime soon. “For this outbreak, it’s clear that long periods of heavy restrictions has not got us to zero cases,” she said."

"Here is the reality of Zero Covid laid bare. There is no escape. If eliminating Covid is the goal, there is no end to lockdowns, no end to restrictions and no end to the constant fear that, at any time, your freedoms will be taken away and your life will be put on hold. Your country can be largely free of the virus for six months, but when one person in a city you have never been to tests positive, lockdown returns. New Zealand will leave this lockdown, but the fear of the next one will remain until the government and the people shake themselves out of this Zero Covid fantasy."
[25] https://www.spiked-online.com/2021/08/19/new-zealands-zero-covid-trap/
"To defend this lockdown, people point to New Zealand’s pitifully low vaccination rate. Less than 35 per cent of New Zealand’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and less than 20 per cent has been fully vaccinated. In comparison, the UK has fully vaccinated around 60 per cent of the population.

Much like in Australia, New Zealanders have been fed the false promise of ‘Zero Covid’ for so long that they are complacent about getting vaccinated. The new case that sparked the lockdown was New Zealand’s first case of transmission within the community in six months. Why get vaccinated if there is next to no risk of catching Covid? If a case emerges, the government will just lock the country down anyway."

"These three island nations have effectively defeated COVID-19 despite their urban population density, proximity to China, and robust international connectivity. Luck was clearly not on their side – but paranoia was. Robust contact tracing, strict lockdowns, enforced quarantines, isolation of vulnerable populations, and other measures were crucial to suppressing the virus in all three places.

The varying locations of these three island nations show that it is not a particular geography that has succeeded but rather a particular geology: the fact of being an island."
[30] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/island-nations-have-the-edge-in-keeping-covid-away-or-most-do
"Island nations have an advantage when it comes to stopping travellers importing disease, be it Covid or other infections.

Seas are usually harder to cross than land, and beaches are easier to police. There are no cross-border towns, and fewer ways to sneak over frontiers.

These advantages, combined with strict quarantine policies, have made island nations some of the most successful at containing Covid. But the ones that did best had shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls."

 Citizens in democracies, it seems, are more likely to abide by the rules set by their governments. This is in line with studies showing that political repression reduces co-operation.

While autocrats often seek to capitalise on perceived threats, their handling of the pandemic will not look appealing to the outside world.

Correcting errors is entirely dependent on the very people who made the blunders in the first place. There are no strong or autonomous power centers that can counter or even temper the decisions of the authoritarian executive. Undemocratic regimes have a vested interest in suppressing information that reflects badly on senior officials, which is precisely what hobbled China’s response in the critical, early days of the virus."

"For decades, governments and development partners promoted neoliberal policies in the health sector in many LMICs, largely motivated by the belief that governments in these countries were too weak to provide all the health services necessary to meet population needs.

The Treasury agreed in March 2020 to pay for a deal to block-book the entire capacity of all 7,956 beds in England’s 187 private hospitals along with their almost 20,000 staff to help supplement the NHS’s efforts to cope with the unfolding pandemic. It is believed to have cost £400m a month.

However, the Centre for Health and the Public Interest’s report (Pdf) says that on 39% of days between March 2020 and March this year, private hospitals treated no Covid patients at all and on a further 20% of days they cared for only one person. Overall, they provided only 3,000 of the 3.6m Covid bed days in those 13 months – just 0.08% of the total."

"Although the Irish hospital network has not been overwhelmed, it has faced pressures, with a total of 13,313 persons hospitalised, including 1402 admitted to the intensive care unit. Out of caution, in spring 2020, in anticipation of possible surges in hospitals in light of international experience, the Irish government reached an agreement with private hospitals to access their capacity for three months to alleviate pressure on the public system, as part of its comprehensive response to the pandemic."

"Manning, 29, said she attempted to contact the New York Times and spoke to a Washington Post reporter during this period but neither newspaper was quick to respond so she gave the information to WikiLeaks, which went on to partner with news organizations including the Guardian to share the leaked information.

Manning said she learned about WikiLeaks during a security training course in 2008 and had begun chatting online with people about the site in 2009. She distinguished her views on leaking from the organization’s, which has propagated a full transparency ethos.

She said that then and now, she believed “there are plenty of things that should be kept secret”.

“Let’s protect sensitive sources,” Manning said. “Let’s protect troop movements. Let’s protect nuclear information. Let’s not hide missteps. Let’s not hide misguided policies. Let’s not hide history. Let’s not hide who we are and what we are doing.”"

A defiant Manning told Judge Anthony Trenga in a federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, that she would “rather starve to death” than do what the state insisted and give testimony before the grand jury. Having already served 62 days in jail, 28 of which were spent in solitary confinement, she now faces up to 18 months more in custody.

Trenga further tightened the screws on the former army private by adding a financial penalty. If Manning continues to refuse testimony and remains in jail after 30 days, she will be fined $500 for every subsequent day behind bars. If she reaches 60 days, the figure will be raised to $1,000 a day."

"After being forced to come to terms with SARS, China’s leaders eventually did enforce quarantine in Beijing and canceled the week-long May Day holiday of 2003. This helped to end the pandemic within a few short months, with minimal impact. SARS infected approximately 8,000 worldwide and killed about 800, 65% of which occurred in China and Hong Kong.

The Chinese government learned from SARS the important role public health plays in protecting the nation. Following SARS, the government improved training of public health professionals and developed one of the most sophisticated disease surveillance systems in the world. While caught off guard for this next big coronavirus outbreak in December 2019, the country quickly mobilized its resources to bring the epidemic almost to a halt inside its borders within three months."

"For instance, the partial reopening of businesses in Georgia on Apr 24th, led to a 13% increase in visitors from nearby states28. This surge in inter-state mobility both increases distance traveled and the amount of clustering in a limited number of areas. The same result occurs if individual businesses or institutions decide on different reopening strategies. For instance, in Burlington, Vermont retail stores were allowed to open with limited capacity on May 18th. While many stores opened on this date, many store owners decided to postpone openings out of safety concerns29. Thus, if a state relaxes restrictions on businesses, but some businesses owners choose to remain closed, this has the same effect demonstrated in our analyses. Scattered or disorganized reopening after lock-down can therefore spark new waves of infection. Critically, reopening more slowly is not necessarily better if done non-uniformly."
