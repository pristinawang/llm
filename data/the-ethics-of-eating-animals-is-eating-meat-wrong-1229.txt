The Ethics of Eating Animals: Is Eating Meat Wrong?

1. Thesis:
Humans should stop eating animal meat.

  1.1. Pro:
  Eating animals is harmful to the environment [1].

    1.1.1. Pro:
    Eating and producing meat heavily contributes to climate change.

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      Current trajectories of dietary patterns alone would lead to failed Paris Agreement global climate goals.[1] [2] This means that if meat production is not mitigated, climate goals are likely to fail leading to many synergistic negative effects and risks on humans and civilization.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Any major industry heavily contributes to climate change. This is not particular to meat production.

        1.1.1.2.1. Con:
        And every major industry will have to contribute towards reducing its climate impact, or even become redundant if its products are not worth their indirect costs - like, arguably, meat.

        1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
        Mass production of almost anything negatively impacts the environment. If the public were to demand more fresh meat and food — without all the chemicals on the plants and in the animals — we would go back to smaller family-owned farms and ranches, which would all but eliminate harm to the environment.

          1.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
          Regardless of the method, the scale would still be vast given the human population and thus would still have environmental impacts.

          1.1.1.2.2.2. Con:
          As long as there are large cities, food production,whether animal or vegetable, will continue at large scale, and will continue to impact the environment.

          1.1.1.2.2.3. Con:
          Without a major devastating calamity, agriculture will not devolve back to primarily small farm production.

        1.1.1.2.3. Con:
        This is a fallacy [3] - two wrongs don't make a right. All the industries that contribute to climate change should be tackled, but that doesn't justify the negative impact that meat industry has on climate change.

      1.1.1.3. Con:
      This does not make eating meat inherently wrong, because the massive scale of our population is the main cause of the massive scale of farming and therefore also the massive scale of green house gas emissions.

        1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
        Reducing meat consumption is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Therefore this argument does not entail a duty to stop meat consumption.

          1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
          Removing meat consumption removes its environmental effect. Reducing it only reduces the environmental effect.

            1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
            The point is not to supress any human environmental effect, but to take it below the threshold at which it is harmful.
            As an example, the environmental impact of meat consumption can be reduced below the impact of vegetable consumption.

          1.1.1.3.1.2. Con:
          We should do everything we can to reduce our damage, even if some is unpreventable - not all of it is.

          1.1.1.3.1.3. Con:
          This claim is an example of the perfect solution fallacy [4] - it implies that just because a problem cannot be solved entirely with one solution, we should not attempt to minimize its effects until a solution can be found, or use a combination solution to ultimately solve it entirely by addressing various factors at once.

        1.1.1.3.2. Con:
        As  vegetarian diets have a lesser impact on resources a massive adoption of vegetarian diets would contribute to a massive cut of greenhouse emissions.

        1.1.1.3.3. Con:
        Overpopulation can't be the only aspect to address green house emissions; response should be focused on life style also, becouse if it's not posible to change life style (Diet, Housing, Mobility, Consumerism) the only way posible to reduce emissions would be to reduce population.

        1.1.1.3.4. Con:
        Whether eating meat is inherently wrong or not, the argument is that we should stop eating it. In the context of the current situation, there is certainly a viable argument to be made that we should stop eating meat to reduce our environmental impact.

        1.1.1.3.5. Con:
        In order to find a sustainable ecological balance, in order to keep the human species alive, we must find ways of reducing and mitigating our carbon debt to the world. Abstaining from eating animal meat (even temporarily) will allow us more time to find solutions to this global problem.

      1.1.1.4. Pro:
      Farming meat has a disproportionate impact on the climate, contributing as many or more greenhouse gases than well-known polluters like cars and other industries.

        1.1.1.4.1. Pro:
        Meat and dairy production directly hurts humans as it uses too much land/resources and produces more greenhouse gases [5] than driving cars.

        1.1.1.4.2. Pro:
        The global livestock sector creates more emissions [6] than the global transport sector.

        1.1.1.4.3. Pro:
        Ruminants from livestock account for about 6.5% [7] of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is the same as 1/10th of all non-agricultural energy usage.

        1.1.1.4.4. Pro:
        The greenhouse gases generated by large meat companies almost compare [8] to those created by large oil companies.

      1.1.1.5. Con:
      Producing meat heavily contributes to climate change. Eating meat does not contribute to climate change. Even if it is true that humans should stop producing meat, it does not follow that humans should stop eating meat (eg. from a hunted wild animal).

        1.1.1.5.1. Con:
        The overwhelming majority of people however consume agriculturally produced meat. Hunting meat at the scale needed to provide for the world's population is not viable.

        1.1.1.5.2. Con:
        That's how supply and demand works. By eating as much meat as we do now we are asking meat producers to continue what they are doing. Eating meat does result in more production and more greenhouse gas emissions.

        1.1.1.5.3. Con:
        Ceasing to eat meat would discourage further production of meat.

        1.1.1.5.4. Con:
        It does not make sense at all to see eight billion people hunting for their own meal every day.

        1.1.1.5.5. Con:
        Deflecting the Climate Change argument to argue for personally hunted meat only shifts the argument to the ethics of killing an animal for food, and attempts to detract from the very real environmental consequences of producing meat at a large scale.

      1.1.1.6. Pro:
      It is critical to address climate change in order to prevent drastic effects (up to and including mass extinctions) on both humans and all other forms of life.

        1.1.1.6.1. Pro:
        The consequences of climate change are not limited to a mere slight warming of the globe; knock-on effects could quite possibly lead to the realistically unpreventable extinction of humanity, and severe effects up to and including mass extinctions on other forms of life as we know it, such as through a global anoxic event. [9]

        1.1.1.6.2. Con:
        Global warming may not be inherently undesirable. As the earth warms, the capacity to produce food increases as land previously too cold for agriculture becomes fertile. While there are costs associated with global warming, some would argue that these are outweighed by the benefits.

          1.1.1.6.2.1. Con:
          The costs associated rising sea levels would be much more significant compared to any benefit when taking into account human displacement and climate refugees, risk of regional conflicts, and damage on existing infrastructure.

        1.1.1.6.3. Con:
        Humans are one of the most adaptable species on earth, we can live in climates from freezing ice to scorching hot.

        1.1.1.6.4. Con:
        There are vast uninhabitable cold regions on earth, if the climate changes we will have pleasant new living spaces. Human settlements have followed climate change since the ice age.

        1.1.1.6.5. Con:
        This is to suggest that climate change is inherently bad. It may actually be of great benefit to many species, and to the Earth as a whole. The climate has fluctuated significantly over the course of Earth's history (the Ice Age, Paleocene-Eocene period) and life as we know it has survived, and has even been strengthened by these changes.

          1.1.1.6.5.1. Con:
          Life as we know it changes significantly when the climate changes. When it changes rapidly, as is the case with human-induced climate change, most animals struggle to adapt fast enough andsuffer greatly as a result. [10]

      1.1.1.7. Con:
      While meat production does entail production of up to 9% [11] of the world's greenhouse gases, the source of the carbon is less problematic than the other 91% of the carbon, mostly produced by fossil fuels. Cows belch methane, but this carbon originates from the atmosphere and goes back into the atmosphere in climate-boosted form. Fossil fuels take carbon formerly sequestered deep underground, and adds it to the atmosphere. So meat is problematic, but not in the same league as fossil fuel.

        1.1.1.7.1. Con:
        Plants used to feed those animals often come from intensive agriculture which needs fossil fuels directly or indirectly (mechanization, fertilizers, pest control). So there is a significant amount of indirect CO2 emission coming from fossil source.

        1.1.1.7.2. Con:
        That's just how you define 'league'. The source of the carbon in this case is hardly relevant, it's the transformation from carbon dioxide into methane that is. The carbon in the methane does not even out with the carbon in the carbon dioxide; methane is a 25 times stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide [12].

        1.1.1.7.3. Con:
        The Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of nitrogen fertilizer is heavily reliant on natural gas. Its use to produce feedstock means that the methane being gassed off by livestock is directly linked to mined hydrocarbons, not only from atmospheric nitrogen.

        1.1.1.7.4. Con:
        Eating in ways that are just less bad than the worst contributor do not justify supporting the runner up contributor, it just compounds the issue.

      1.1.1.8. Pro:
      22% of meat ends up in landfills in U.S, Canada, Australia, & New Zealand, collectively [13]. Meat in landfills releases methane, which is 35x as potent in Global Warming Potential as carbon dioxide [14] over the span of a century.

        1.1.1.8.1. Pro:
        Plant matter also does not become 'unsafe' to consume nearly as quickly as any meat product.

      1.1.1.9. Pro:
      Meat's transport and storage requirements consume more resources and generate more emissions than for vegetables.

        1.1.1.9.1. Con:
        The facts aren't so simple, as shown in this study [15], switching to a less meat-heavy diet might actually cause emissions and energy consumption to increase rather than decrease. One has to keep in mind that not only the production affects the environment - to get the product from the farm to your nearest store one needs transportation. Vegetables are in general less (calorie/nutrient)-dense and therefore you need a bigger volume of them to feed people.

          1.1.1.9.1.1. Con:
          The study [16] is based on a "per-calorie" comparison, where broccoli (34kcal/100g) is compared to beef (228kcal/100g). While it is true that some vegetables are less calorie-dense, others are far more calorie-dense than meat, beans [17] for example. Beans are a more likely substitute for meat than broccoli, making vegetables less carbon-heavy.

          1.1.1.9.1.2. Con:
          This study did not address the fact that feeding the animals also requires massive amounts of plants and water.

        1.1.1.9.2. Pro:
        Vegetables have a bigger volume but less weight. Additionally when considering the impact of transportation, we can't forget about the requirement for refrigeration of meat products compared to others. As stated, the impact of transportation is not so simple.

        1.1.1.9.3. Pro:
        A high percentage of Meat is dense and high in moisture its moisture content at the time of its transportation. Its moisture content giving it a shorter shelf-life, and its weight making it more expensive when transported.

        1.1.1.9.4. Con:
        This could be remedied by electric semis for transportation and powering storage facilites with solar power.

      1.1.1.10. Pro:
      Focusing on the gasses released by live stock alone doesn't take into account the huge swathes of forest which are destroyed not only to house these animals, but also to grow feed. These forests are burned which releases large amounts of C02 and also takes away one of the best natural converters of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Feeding humanity with plants would require significantly less land use.

        1.1.1.10.1. Pro:
        Livestock takes up 30% of Earth's land surface. Forests, which help absorb C02, are being cleared to create pastures. 70% of the Amazon forest has been cut down for cattle grazing. timeforchange.org [18]

          1.1.1.10.1.1. Pro:
          Livestock takes up over 30% of habitable land on earth, equivalent to nearly the combine landmass of both American continents. While livestock uses 77% of all agricultural land it only provides 17% of calories, and 33% of protein consumed world wide.Yields and Land Use In Agriculture, Our World In Data [19]

      1.1.1.11. Con:
      Producing meat only has a substantial impact on Carbon Dioxide and methane emissions. There are greenhouse gases with 32,000 times the Greenhouse Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2 and 4,289 times the GWP of Methane. Other greenhouse gases should be our priority as carbon emissions are reversible if re-forestation and re-greening efforts are made. ghginstitute.org [20]

      1.1.1.12. Con:
      The fact that meat eating and production contributes to climate change is not an argument for complete abstention from eating meat, it is only an argument for reducing the impact of meat eating, either through reduction in per capital amounts eaten or more sustainable farming practices.

        1.1.1.12.1. Pro:
        Through the consumption of meat that is raised by respecting the nature of ruminant animals we can regenerate land into highly productive prairie and farmland. It has been scientifically proven by the Rodale Institute and other regenerative farmers that ruminant animals and multi-specieated farms can and will regenerate land and help sequester carbon in our soil where it belongs. By mimicking nature we right the wrongs of factory farming and KAFO's.  rodaleinstitute.org [21] www.resilience.org [22]

        1.1.1.12.2. Pro:
        There are ways to reduce the carbon impact of meat.

          1.1.1.12.2.1. Pro:
          Husbandry [23] is one of our best bets to solve the problem of desertification.

            1.1.1.12.2.1.1. Con:
            There is a lack of scientific evidence [24] supporting this theory.

            1.1.1.12.2.1.2. Con:
            There are alternative vegan solutions [25] to desertification.

            1.1.1.12.2.1.3. Con:
            Studies [26] and ecologists have concluded that no grazing system has yet shown the capacity to overcome the long-term effects of overstocking and/or drought on vegetation productivity.

          1.1.1.12.2.2. Pro:
          About 40% of food is wasted [27], which is a significant contributor to carbon emissions; by reducing the amount of food wasted, we would reduce the carbon impact of meat production.

          1.1.1.12.2.3. Pro:
          Producing meat with traditional agriculture contributes to climate change; But producing with sustainable methods [28] actually increases land fertility all around, to the benefit of man, plant, and animal.

          1.1.1.12.2.4. Pro:
          Reducing the amount of meat consumed by humans would have a positive impact on climate change without requiring people to stop eating meat entirely. If we all reduced our meat intake by even 50%, we would make huge strides in decreasing climate change.

          1.1.1.12.2.5. Con:
          The mere reduction, rather than elimination, of meat's carbon impact may not be enough to combat climate change.

          1.1.1.12.2.6. Pro:
          Not all meat consumption is equally bad for the environment: eating a cow that grazed on unfarmable grassland, is slaughtered at the farm, and is then consumed there does not contribute particularly much to climate change.

          1.1.1.12.2.7. Pro:
          A diet including meat can be sustainable and without negative consequences to the environment. It is not about what you eat, but about the right way of farming and keeping animals.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.1. Pro:
            Consuming meat from organic livestock farming could help to mitigate these risks.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.1.1. Pro:
              Organic farmers do not use antibiotics [29]. This reduces the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [30] entering the food chain.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.1.2. Con:
              Currently organic farming [31] accounts for only a small percentage [32] of livestock farming and it is unrealistic to think we can provide for current levels of meat consumption via fair organic livestock farming. Thus, a massive reduction of meat consumption would be required nonetheless.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.2. Con:
            That organic production is sustainable is a myth [33] because it produces relatively more CO2 emissions and requires more space.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.3. Con:
            All farm animals require more water [34] per kg of food output than plants do. Therefore, it is always more sustainable to eat plant foods.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.3.1. Con:
              If meat production is less efficient, it only argues for moderated meat consumption, not a total prohibition on meat consumption.

                1.1.1.12.2.7.3.1.1. Con:
                In today's society and the current state of the world, inefficiency has a negative effect on sustainability, which may have severe impacts on the future of human existence, and even other animals and life as a whole.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.3.2. Con:
              A more relevant metric than food weight is food energy. Therefore, a better metric than liter/kg would be liter/kilocalorie or even breaking it down to "liter per gram" of macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates, and alcohol).

                1.1.1.12.2.7.3.2.1. Pro:
                Using this metric, animal sources of protein are not less sustainable than vegetarian ones. Cattle are still least efficient. However, industrially farmed broiler chickens have less of an impact than farming nuts (Page 29, Table 6 [35]).

            1.1.1.12.2.7.4. Pro:
            Unnatural methods of farming could be easily curbed if industrial nations consumed less meat. Everyone being on a meatless diet is not necessary.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.4.1. Con:
              This still suggests a need for a massive reduction in the amount of meat consumed to stop particularly unnatural methods of meat production. Even then, animals would be being slaughtered for food, such that the best ethical outcome is for everyone to stop eating meat.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.4.2. Pro:
              Industrial livestock farming results from peoples' hunger for tons of cheap meat. If people would consume meat only once a week we would not need these unethical structures.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.4.3. Con:
              Eating meat encourages increased meat production; not eating meat discourages it. Therefore, humans who are aware of the issues should stop eating meat, to reduce the demand for it and hence, the prevalence of unnatural and immoral farming methods.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.5. Pro:
            Industrial, monoculture based, factory farmed meat is indeed bad in many ways. However, it represents only one failed model of agriculture. Permaculture based farming [36] with strategic rotational grazing programs, have been shown to create many positive and vital ecological outcomes as well as improved ethics. Meat production, done in this manner, provides a very real and powerful tool in battling climate change, erosion, pollination and habitat loss, loss of bio diversity, and lack of soil health.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.5.1. Pro:
              Animals are present in any ecological system. Farming systems [37] that emulate natural systems by integrating animals are often more holistic and resilient.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.5.2. Con:
              In modern western society, the majority of people eat bad, industrially-farmed meat. So, while in a vacuum eating meat might be a boon to the environment, in practice today it is not.

                1.1.1.12.2.7.5.2.1. Con:
                That is not a statement about eating animals as much as it is the system of agriculture that has become normalized. If we push to shift that model of farming, towards a more permaculture based agriculture system, then we also change the nature of this debate.

              1.1.1.12.2.7.5.3. Con:
              The farming techniques of permaculture haven't been shown to be effective for meat production on the large scale required to fulfill global need.

                1.1.1.12.2.7.5.3.1. Pro:
                The cost of permaculture and sustainable meat farming would make meat a luxury product and move the industry to a completely different economy.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.6. Pro:
            Raising livestock in a responsible way is a crucial part of the nutrient cycle that supports organic farming.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.7. Pro:
            Meat should be eaten sparingly, and its externalities and environmental costs should be taken into account in its price. This will directly contribute to a higher price, and less meat consumption.

            1.1.1.12.2.7.8. Pro:
            According to an Austrian study [38], it is actually possible to provide a diet similar to that of rich countries to all of the world's population without further deforestation.

        1.1.1.12.3. Pro:
        An ethical diet is not one which eliminates greenhouse gas emissions or other forms of harm; if it were, the best diet would be starvation. Instead, an ethical diet strives to balance a variety of goals; health, taste, environmental impact, cultural legacy etc. In that case, a diet which includes some meat (but perhaps less than a typical diet in a developed country) would be morally permissible.

        1.1.1.12.4. Con:
        The amount of land required to produce the same amount of calories is nearly 5 times greater than is required for crops. With a growing population the consumption of meat could come at a detrimental cost. Yields and Land Use In Agriculture, Our World In Data [39]

      1.1.1.13. Con:
      The net effects of climate change are not obviously bad. There's no reason to believe the climate is perfectly optimized the way it is.

      1.1.1.14. Con:
      1 kg of chicken produces 6,9 kg CO2 eq; 1 kg of vegetables about 1.5-2 kg CO2 eq (www.greeneatz.com [40]). However, chicken has about 3-5 times more calories and up to 10 times as much protein as many vegetables, meaning you need to consume less of it on a kg to kg basis. A single mile in an airplane produces about 24 kg CO2 eq (blueskymodel.org [41]), about the same as 2 pounds of beef - so one single domestic flight will usually offset a person's meat-related carbon emissions for a whole year.

      1.1.1.15. Pro:
      Livestock [42] account for an estimated 18% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, producing 40% of the world’s methane and 65% of the world’s nitrous oxide.

        1.1.1.15.1. Pro:
        Farming cows and sheep are responsible for 37% of the total methane [43] generated by human activity.

          1.1.1.15.1.1. Con:
          While the farming of cattle appears to emit methane due to digestion of grassars, grass  dies and rots (emitting methand) as part of its natural cycle if not eaten.

          1.1.1.15.1.2. Con:
          As noted in a comment to that claim, the FAO's more recent data significantly reduces this figure, to 14.5% of the total human-casued greenhouse gas emissions. "Total emissions from global livestock: 7.1 Gigatonnes of Co2-equiv per year, representing 14.5 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions." www.fao.org [44]

            1.1.1.15.1.2.1. Con:
            14.5% is still a significant contribution to climate change, and ought to be taken into account.

        1.1.1.15.2. Con:
        Most animals do not contribute to climate change because their net affect on CO2 and CH4 is zero (they consume CO2 and CH4 indirectly via the plants that are grown specifically to feed the animals).

          1.1.1.15.2.1. Con:
          Methane [45] is a by-product of the bacteria which help with digestion. It is not consumed by the animals.

          1.1.1.15.2.2. Con:
          Methane [46] is a far stronger ozone-disrupting agent than CO2, even on a per-carbon-atom basis.

          1.1.1.15.2.3. Con:
          In the absence of farm animals, more plants would be grown to feed humans directly, so net emissions would decrease.

          1.1.1.15.2.4. Con:
          A vegan diet would consume the plants that the animal ate, and would in the same manner indirectly consume CO2 and CH4 as you claim. The difference is that the animal becomes inefficient. The animal have to use the energy to grow and to live, where there is a spillage of energy from what it ate. By not eating animals we exclude this factor, which is the whole reason that a vegan diet is more environmentally sustainable.

          1.1.1.15.2.5. Pro:
          Farm animals eat grass and animal feed, which took exactly as much CO2 out of the atmosphere during growing as the animals give back during digestion. Therefore animal farming does not contribute to climate change, it keeps it in balance.

        1.1.1.15.3. Con:
        Climate change does not make eating meat inherently wrong. A small population eating anything in sustainable amounts would be the solution to climate change issues. What you're successfully arguing here is actually that overpopulation is wrong.

          1.1.1.15.3.1. Pro:
          Land conversion for crops, massive city infrastructure, human waste and energy consumption also all significantly contribute to climate change. All of these things can be inhibited by a smaller population.

          1.1.1.15.3.2. Con:
          The amounts and quality of what you eat should be determined by what´s sustainable to eat at this moment, for everyone, to live safe and healthy without sacrificing the future of the planet. All other aspects of daily life should be adressed this way.

          1.1.1.15.3.3. Con:
          It is not viable to immediately reduce overpopulation through any sane, viable, or ethical means. Even if future generations may enjoy greater comforts and luxuries due to hopeful reductions in global overpopulation, this generation must make sacrifices in order to ensure such generations can even exist.

        Animals produce methane [47] which is bad for the environment.

          1.1.1.15.4.1. Pro:
          In 2011, methane from livestock accounted for 39% of all the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, according to a report [48] from United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization. Farmers trying to keep up with demand for meat is having a negative effect on the natural ecosystem.

          1.1.1.15.4.2. Pro:
          Animals bred for slaughter are often overfed a poor diet. Overfed animals produce an excess of methane. Methane contributes to the greenhouse heating of our ecosystem. Every degree our planet's temperature is raised causes seismotic changes in the regulation of function. news.berkeley.edu [49]

          1.1.1.15.4.3. Con:
          All animals including humans and many plant related source produce methane and not just livestock. Source: link.springer.com [50]
          Therefore replacing livestock with rice pads would not be a great idea.

        1.1.1.15.5. Pro:
        Meat needs 10 times more land and water than vegetables. Impacts of changing land use to pastures or gmo-crops (for livestock feed) are deforestation and even desertification. This as world tendency decreases de overall biocapacity of environment to neutralize greenhouse emissions.

        1.1.1.15.6. Con:
        Research shows that livestock actually helps to restore vegetation growth, reverses desertification and with that, helps to store more CO2.youtube.com [51]

          1.1.1.15.6.1. Con:
          These are animals that live in the open grass; but most animals that are used for meat, dairy and eggs do not live on open fields, they live inside.

          1.1.1.15.6.2. Con:
          The land that is destroyed for animal agriculture wouldn't have to be destroyed in the first place if we didn't consume animal products.

        -> See 1.1.1.7.3.

        1.1.1.15.8. Con:
        This source [52] seems to disagree with these numbers.

        1.1.1.15.9. Con:
        Researchers found out that an addition of 2 percent dried seaweed to a cow’s diet can reduce methane emissions by 99 percent. [53] As a result, eating meat doesn't need to be stopped in order to effectively fight climate change.

      1.1.1.16. Con:
      If humans stopped producing meat, the livestock would not simply disappear overnight and many of the animals could return to nature and reproduce.

      1.1.1.17. Con:
      Livestock-born GHG emissions have mostly been interpreted isolated from their ecosystemic context, ignoring their negligible significance within the global balance. There is no scientific evidence [54], whatsoever, that domestic livestock could represent a risk for the Earth’s climate.

      1.1.1.18. Pro:
      The meat [55] lover's diet has the worst carbon footprint: about double the amount of a vegan diet.

        1.1.1.18.1. Con:
        Researchers [56] at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) say that a diet with more fruits, vegetables, dairy and seafood would actually be worse in terms of emissions than what Americans currently eat.

          1.1.1.18.1.1. Con:
          The researchers did not find that producing vegetables is more harmful to the environment than producing meat. What they found, in light of the data they examined, is that producing some vegetables and other foods results in high use of natural resources – and that eating more of those foods (as recommended for health by the USDA) in two particular scenarios results in higher energy use, blue water footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.

          1.1.1.18.1.2. Con:
          "[T]he results showed that getting our weight under control and eating fewer calories, has a positive effect on the environment and reduces energy use, water use and GHG emissions from the food supply chain by approximately 9 percent." cmu.edu [57]

          1.1.1.18.1.3. Pro:
          Shifting consumption to eating more sustainable meats like chicken and pork is a better solution than phasing out all of meats. As the source above says, chicken and pork do not consume nearly as many fossil fuels as some vegetarian alternatives. Maybe a shift away from red meat (cow) is what is necessary.

        1.1.1.18.2. Pro:
        Eating a plant-rich diet ranks as the fourth-most effective way [58] to combat climate change.

          1.1.1.18.2.1. Pro:
          Universal veganism from today would reduce [59] agriculture-related carbon emissions by 17%, methane emissions by 24%, and nitrous oxide emissions by 21% by 2050. Universal vegetarianism would cause similar effects [60].

          1.1.1.18.2.2. Pro:
          According to a major Oxford University study [61], adopting global vegetarian diets would cut food-related emissions by 63%.

        1.1.1.18.3. Con:
        Many vegan diet staples actually have a bigger impact on the environment and water resources than meat production, such as almond milk [62].

        1.1.1.18.4. Pro:
        A report by Worldwatch Institute states that animal farming is responsible for 51% [63] of global greenhouse gases.

          1.1.1.18.4.1. Con:
          And if it were replaced by vegetable farming, then vegetable farming would be the major contributor.

        1.1.1.18.5. Con:
        Vegan diets not only potentially harm our bodies but the majority result in eating imported, high environmental footprint foods, that require massive amounts of crop land. Good livestock husbandry can actually heal and protect land.

          1.1.1.18.5.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.1.12.2.1.

          1.1.1.18.5.2. Con:
          Vegan diets have been proved as healthy as non vegan diets, even more so in some aspects [1] [64] and the footprint of vegans is way smaller than meat eaters [2] [65].

          1.1.1.18.5.3. Con:
          Much of the imported food is more environmentally-friendly than animal husbandry due to the releases of methane from those animals. Thus one cannot argue that imported food by default is worse for the environment.

            1.1.1.18.5.3.1. Con:
            Imported food is transported over long distances (there are exceptions, but it is generally true)

          1.1.1.18.5.4. Con:
          Good land-use, crop-rotation and green-fertilizing can also heal and protect land.

          1.1.1.18.5.5. Pro:
          Some vegan foods use more water than beef. In fact the food that uses the most water to make per pound is vanilla. Even chocolate uses more water to grow than beef. [66] To heal the planet the consumption of all three of these foods should be lowered.

            1.1.1.18.5.5.1. Con:
            It's quite plain to see that no one will eat half a pound of pure vanilla or pure chocolate. These are not staples of anyone's diets like meat is, it's a false equivalence.

          1.1.1.18.5.6. Pro:
          Some vegan foods like tofu generate the same or more CO2 amounts than meat (like seafood). [67]

            1.1.1.18.5.6.1. Con:
            By looking at individual cases, it's obvious that there will be some few kinds of crops that will demand even more resourses than meat in general, simply because there are thousands of different plants cultivated for food around the world. But in the big picture, someone who eats beef regularly will have a way bigger footprint because of its enormous chain of production required when compared with a typical vegetarian diet.

              1.1.1.18.5.6.1.1. Con:
              If the big picture is looked at, then beef is not a good reference (especially since people are starting to eat chicken more than beef). If anything, all meats should be compared to all vegetarian foods in terms of resource use per nutrient value to see which foods are the best to consume.

            1.1.1.18.5.6.2. Con:
            The idea that soy (tofu) uses more water and land than beef is erroneous. Such claims include growing soy to feed livestock. If we only grew soy to feed humans, the energy and water consumption of growing soy would be a fraction of that used to farm beef.

        1.1.1.18.6. Con:
        Transforming into a vegan diet may do very little to reduce climate change as business organisations may simply create artificial products for human consumption that may re-enforce the issue of greenhouse gasses and pollution thereby re-enforcing the issue of climate change rather than ending it and further adding to the poor diet in humans

          1.1.1.18.6.1. Con:
          If somebody becomes conscious enough to turn to a vegan diet, there's a good chance that the person also questions other aspects of his diet, like the precedence of the products, the quality of the ingredients and the footprint it may have.

            1.1.1.18.6.1.1. Con:
            There is no data suggesting that there is a "good chance" that such a person would question other aspects of their diet.

          1.1.1.18.6.2. Con:
          Just because something can go wrong in one very specific way does not mean it is not worth attempting where other outcomes are possible, especially if the risk of adverse outcomes is known and addressed.

          1.1.1.18.6.3. Con:
          Evidence of this is needed because actually, there is strong evidence that reducing the meat production can reduce greenhouse gases. Less beef less carbon [68] FAO [69]

          1.1.1.18.6.4. Con:
          There are a lot of 'may' statements in this argument. Also, the assumption that not eating meat leads to a 'poor' diet. This is not sound reasoning nor reliable argument.

          1.1.1.18.6.5. Con:
          Artificial meat products would not cause any of the environmental harms [70] of meat, since production would not require grazing areas, the use of grain, or the creation of methane.

        1.1.1.18.7. Con:
        The same source (now down, reup here: www.mdpi.com [71]) also shows that beef makes the biggest difference. A beefless diet is only marginally worse in terms of GHG emissions than a vegetarian's/vegans diet. Another graphic from the same source (reup here: pbs.twimg.com [72]) also showed that the carbon intensity of fruit is actually 20% higher than that of poultry, pork or fish

    1.1.2. Pro:
    Farming animals has severe impacts on the local environment due to its heavy resource use and impact upon the landscape.

      1.1.2.1. Con:
      Many of the animals that we kill for meat, such as kangaroos or deer, are pests that are bad for natural ecosystems or for agriculture. Demand for their meat actually creates net benefits for the environment.

        1.1.2.1.1. Con:
        The above claim seems dependent on specific ecosystems.

        1.1.2.1.2. Con:
        The definition of 'pest' is itself a normative description that privileges human activities; e.g. kangaroos are pests because they eat crops. To hunt and kill them thus serves our own purposes, not any 'natural order.'

        1.1.2.1.3. Con:
        If it is beneficial to kill pests, then we can do that without needing to eat their meat.

          1.1.2.1.3.1. Con:
          At the point pests are being killed, consuming their meat at least helps offset the need for other non-pest species to be raised and killed.

          1.1.2.1.3.2. Con:
          This literally works out to "At least we're still allowed to waste meat we kill".  Refusing to eat or otherwise consume and use this harvested meat is literally the most wasteful thing that could be suggested- even if it is not suitable for human consumption, it can still be made into pet or animal feed, or into fertilizer, etc.

        1.1.2.1.4. Pro:
        Humans, as apex predators who have usurped the predatory apexes of the other predators in the ecosystems we have come to also inhabit, have an ethical responsibility to keep those ecosystems in check so that, eg, rampant deer populations do not cause deforestation and subsequent ecosystem collapse.  Even where there are populations of healthy apex predators, these populations should also be checked so they do not cause problems and kill people- and it would be unethical to waste that meat.

          1.1.2.1.4.1. Con:
          We have already warped the ecosystem through domestication and selective breeding. We can put effort into reinstating these animals' natural habits, as animal experts sometimes do with orphaned or injured animals, and have had success with.
          
          We also have notable success of restoring ecosystems by reinstating the natural predators that once lived there:How reintroducing wolves saved a famous park [73].

          1.1.2.1.4.2. Con:
          There's no reason to believe ecosystems are good the way they are. Old ecosystems are replaced by new ones. The balance of nature is a long debunked [74] ecological myth.

        1.1.2.1.5. Con:
        The majority of meat consumption is from cows, pigs, chickens, lamb, turkeys, not deer or kangaroo.

        1.1.2.1.6. Pro:
        Insects are numerous and contribute to vegetable crop destruction. Humans could have a large impact on the adverse effects of insects by eating them.

        1.1.2.1.7. Con:
        The morality of hunting is irrelevant to whether farming is bad for the environment.

        1.1.2.1.8. Con:
        The context of this argument (this specific sub-point) is directly related to farming, not hunting animals. Proposing an argument of benefits of hunting overpopulated animals is a misrepresentation of the argument.

      1.1.2.2. Pro:
      Livestock have severe effects on their immediate environment, causing issues such as  overgrazing, compaction, and erosion [75].

        1.1.2.2.1. Con:
        Overgrazing and compaction are not inevitable effects of livestock, but of improper management of livestock. compaction is more dependent on the type of soil and climate in which the livestock reside, than it is upon the presence of livestock. Erosion is always happening regardless of the presence of livestock.

      1.1.2.3. Pro:
      The production of meat consumes disproportionately more resources than the production of crops.

        1.1.2.3.1. Pro:
        77% [76] of the worlds agricultural land is given over to livestock production.

        1.1.2.3.2. Pro:
        The demand for, and pollution of, water resources from farming animals is immense.

          1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro:
          It takes 100,000 [77] liters of water to produce one kilogram of grain-fed beef.

          1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro:
          According to the Worldwatch Institute, "As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable [78] to the world's chronically hungry."

          1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro:
          Widespread overgrazing [79] disturbs water cycles, reducing replenishment of above and below ground water resources.

          1.1.2.3.2.4. Con:
          This applies to concentrated industrial operations. It does not apply to organic permaculture or intensive grazing practices.

            1.1.2.3.2.4.1. Con:
            The resource requirements from all three are extremely intense. The impacts on a per calorie basis are actually more intensive [80] for organic permaculture. Analysis on a per acre basis certainly reduced impact significantly, but given that the productivity of these approaches is so much lower than traditional agriculture it stays a net negative and the above point is maintained.

          1.1.2.3.2.5. Pro:
          According to a United Nations initiative [81], the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a "massive scale" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.

            1.1.2.3.2.5.1. Pro:
            Livestock farming causes massive nitrogen pollution.

              1.1.2.3.2.5.1.1. Pro:
              At least 10 million [82] people in Europe are potentially exposed to drinking water with nitrate concentrations above recommended levels.

              1.1.2.3.2.5.1.2. Pro:
              Nitrates cause toxic algal blooms [83] and dead zones in the sea, especially in the North, Adriatic and Baltic seas and along the coast of Brittany.

              1.1.2.3.2.5.1.3. Pro:
              In the forests, nitrogen pollution has caused at least 10% loss [84] of plant diversity across two-thirds of Europe.

              1.1.2.3.2.5.1.4. Con:
              Nitrogen pollution is not exclusively caused by livestock farming, but by excessively fertilizing agriculture [85] in general.

                1.1.2.3.2.5.1.4.1. Con:
                Fields are fertilized by animal manure. Thus the nitrogen pollution in agriculture is caused by livestock.

            1.1.2.3.2.5.2. Pro:
            The livestock industry generates 64 % of ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain [86].

            1.1.2.3.2.5.3. Pro:
            Pollution of our waterways [87] is caused by animal waste, antibiotics and hormones entering the water cycle alongside chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers, and the pesticides used to spray feed crops.

            1.1.2.3.2.5.4. Pro:
            According to the Worldwatch Institute, "Declining livestock herds will take pressure off [88] rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate."

          1.1.2.3.2.6. Pro:
          The livestock sector is probably the largest source of water pollution [89] (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, and pesticides).

          1.1.2.3.2.7. Pro:
          The livestock sector is contributing to eutrophication [90].

            1.1.2.3.2.7.1. Pro:
            Livestock are estimated to be the main inland source [91] of phosphorous and nitrogen contamination in the South China Sea. This had contributed to biodiversity loss in marine ecosystems.

          1.1.2.3.2.8. Pro:
          Raising livestock accounts for roughly 23% of all global water use [92] in agriculture, equivalent to 1.15 liters of water per person per day.

            1.1.2.3.2.8.1. Pro:
            It takes about 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef, and about 660 gallons to make a pound of chicken. It only takes about 220 gallons to make a pound of tofu and 180 to make a pound of wheat flour. So a vegetarian diet conserves water [93].

              1.1.2.3.2.8.1.1. Con:
              These calculations are based on the most extreme situations. On average it takes about 441 gallons [94] of water per pound for US beef.

        1.1.2.3.3. Pro:
        According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), 60% of the world’s agricultural land is used for grazing livestock and 1/4 of the world’s croplands is used for animal feed. In total, 2/3 of the world’s agricultural area and 1/3 of the total global land area is used for maintaining livestock [95].

        1.1.2.3.4. Pro:
        Meat production uses twice as much land, water, and feed to produce the same amount of calorie intake [96] as other foods.

          1.1.2.3.4.1. Con:
          Calorie intake is not the only measure of agricultural productivity; factors like nutrient content matter as well.

        1.1.2.3.5. Pro:
        It takes [97] two kg of grain to produce one kg of chicken, and between five and twenty kg of grain to produce one pound of beef.

          1.1.2.3.5.1. Con:
          It's more like 6 pounds [98] to produce one pound of beef. But ruminants can eat plants that humans cannot. Like waste or grassland that doesn't support growing other crops.

        1.1.2.3.6. Pro:
        The production of meat uses up agricultural land that should instead be used to grow crops.

          1.1.2.3.6.1. Pro:
          It is estimated that global vegetarianism would free up 2.8 billion [99] hectares of land.

          1.1.2.3.6.2. Pro:
          About 70% [100] of the world's agricultural land is used for animal pastures.

          1.1.2.3.6.3. Pro:
          About 60% [101]  of US pasture land suffers from overgrazing, which rapidly erodes the soil and makes it unfit for future agricultural production.

          1.1.2.3.6.4. Con:
          The organic manure produced by animals is useful in the growing of crops.

            1.1.2.3.6.4.1. Con:
            It is unlikely that the amount of manure produced is enough to compensate for the loss of productive farmland.

          1.1.2.3.6.5. Con:
          In many cases land is best suited (or only suited) to farming meat; meaning that converting it to crops would be less efficient and thus cause greater environmental harms.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.1. Pro:
            Village farmers often rely on their animals to store energy for their consumption over the winter or over dry seasons when harvests are poor.

              1.1.2.3.6.5.1.1. Con:
              The world is becoming more urban and developed. A long-term perspective should be focused on mass consumption in urban areas, not village farmers.

              1.1.2.3.6.5.1.2. Con:
              More affluent people consume the most meat, so the discussion should be focused on them.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.2. Pro:
            Not all forms of terrain support intensive vegetable farming because the soil is poor, or the terrain too steep. Keeping animals in these areas displaces the need to raze new land for agricultural use.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.3. Pro:
            Farmers often rely on grazing animals to collect energy from a tropic level that cannot be accessed by humans. The meat gained from these animals has minimal costs to the environment yet is productive.

            We can raise animals in terrain that we cannot raise vegetables or grain. Areas such as steep slopes and high mountain sides can be successfully grazed in a sustainable, ecological way, but cannot be used for growing vegetables or grains without energy intensive and destructive modifications.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.5. Pro:
            Grasslands and plains make great areas to raise livestock but bad areas for farming due to lack of water or soil nutrients.

              1.1.2.3.6.5.5.1. Pro:
              A lot of land for cattle is not suitable for crops, because (for example) it might be too rocky or uneven. To convert this land to productive plant use would be devastating to the landscape and contribute to issues such as topsoil erosion.

            In harsh climates of the world, the transport and storage of fresh fruits and vegetables could cause ecological consequences that outweigh the benefits of ceasing local livestock production.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.7. Pro:
            Not all land is good for planting human food, you need pastures. With pastures you can get herbivores to eat unedibe grass and transform it into eat into edible meat

                Many methods of soil-free agriculture exist. Methods like aeroponics are used by NASA [104] in space experimentally. The possible yields rival [105] the need for anywhere near as much farmland as is used today. The microbes [106] in soil process the environment in ways that break them down into the same nutrients available through liquid nutrient solutions.

            Responsible ruminant herd grazing programs actively combat desertification, which provides meat eaters a tertiary motivation to preserve green space.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.10. Pro:
            Many natural rangelands are low-investment nutritional resources which can only be made useful to humans by using them to raise livestock.

              1.1.2.3.6.5.10.1. Pro:
              Ruminants can eat grass which would be useless for the nutrition of humans otherwise.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.11. Pro:
            Farming plants utterly destroys the environment. About 15% of the USA has been cleared, razed to dust, plowed, and replaced with planted crops. The damage to the environment is the total destruction of native plants and massive disruption of native fauna. Grazing is much less destructive. Concentrated feed lots use a negligible area by comparison. (but depend on planted crops, the analysis of the problem is just not simple).

            1.1.2.3.6.5.12. Con:
            There is far less land [107] where only and exclusively livestock can be raised than there is agricultural land where plant foods can grow. If we, therefore, use the land that was previously used for livestock to produce crops, we won't feel the need to even use those remote lands where only livestock can be fed.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.13. Con:
            There are new methods [108] of farming (hydroponics [109], etc) that allow us to grow crops indoors or on the land where there was previously nothing at all, or just livestock.

            1.1.2.3.6.5.14. Pro:
            Some level of animal husbandry is an integral part of a farm's nutrients cycle: from grass, to manure, to fertilizer. In alpine regions, where no crops grow, animals do not only increase the efficiency of the land but often are the most efficient way to use it to produce food. Thus, based on these two reasons, there is a justified level of animal husbandry (which is far below current level).

        1.1.2.3.7. Con:
        While the practices of meat production in high-income industrialised countries tend to be resource inefficient, meat production in other countries is a lot more efficient [110]. Rather than ceasing production altogether, we should ban inefficient methods of production.

        1.1.2.3.8. Pro:
        A lot of the world's crops are currently used for animal feed, rather than human consumption.

          1.1.2.3.8.1. Pro:
          Corn is commonly used as a feed grain in beef cattle [111] diets. Only 11% [112] of the total US corn production for 2013-14 was directly made into food for the US market, compared with 33% for livestock feed.

          1.1.2.3.8.2. Pro:
          Growing food exclusively for direct human consumption, rather than using some of it for animal feed, could increase available food calories by as much as 70% [113], which could feed an additional 4 billion people.

          1.1.2.3.8.3. Pro:
          36% of the calories produced by the world's crops are being used for animal feed, of which only 12% [114] then turn into animal products that can be eaten by the human population. That is a waste of 24% of the world's crops.

            1.1.2.3.8.3.1. Pro:
            It is more efficient to grow plants for food for people than it is to grow plants for food for animals that will be slaughtered for food for people.

          1.1.2.3.8.4. Con:
          The solution isn't to stop eating meat, but rather to eat meat that has not been grain-fed (or fed on other potential human food-sources).

            1.1.2.3.8.4.1. Pro:
            A benefit of this is that it lets farmers convert inedible organic matter (grass, weeds, plant waste) into edible organic matter (meat, offal, gelatin, milk).

          1.1.2.3.8.5. Con:
          Inedible byproducts of existing plant-based food production (e.g. soybean pods) can be used to feed livestock.

          1.1.2.3.8.6. Pro:
          The livestock industry relies heavily on grains and oilseeds. The growing world population can not be fed if we keep using land for the production of feed for animals. tandfonline.com [115]

            1.1.2.3.8.6.1. Pro:
            40% of global grain production is fed to livestock. 
            To put this in perspective, the US alone could feed 
            800 million people [116] with the grain that is fed to livestock.

          1.1.2.3.8.7. Pro:
          Soybeans, predominantly in the form of soybean meal, are a major ingredient in global livestock feed [117], especially for chickens, pigs and cattle.

        1.1.2.3.9. Pro:
        Irrigation systems channel a catchment's water to agricultural uses rather than lead it follow it's natural path over a landscape. This deprives natural water ways and landscapes of their water supply and degrades local ecosystems.

          1.1.2.3.9.1. Con:
          Provided the water use itself does not disrupt the water cycle of flowing from mountains to seas or lakes, such use would be reasonably acceptable. In addition, there must be a lot more benefits from that endeavor than just letting the water just flow right away.

        1.1.2.3.10. Pro:
        Agricultural use of water disrupts the water table equilibrium and leads to desertification [118] and salinification [119].

        1.1.2.3.11. Con:
        There are countries where 99.9% of farming is grass fed. Industrial farming need not rely on grain - the nutrients are better, and the animals happier if you don't. Free range. Ethical farming practices would have one trying to replicate natural conditions. IMO, the same applies to agriculture, and recreating ecoystems/permaculture. We shouldn't I think, aim for the cheapest system - we should aim for the best system, to live on the earth, like we intend to stay here.

          1.1.2.3.11.1. Con:
          There is not enough land available for grazing to support our current demands for meat. Switching Western/modernized countries back to "free range" practices would require a dramatic reduction in meat consumption.

        1.1.2.3.12. Pro:
        Meat is inefficient. In growing animals for meat consumption the animal will always consume a significantly larger energy content in plant matter than can be obtained from the meat of that animal (less than 5%). This is due to the animal wasting massive quantities of energy in heating, digestion and movement.

          1.1.2.3.12.1. Pro:
          If all the grains used to feed farm animals were instead used for human consumption many people who are' starving' around the world could have a better diet.

        1.1.2.3.13. Pro:
        Energy obtained from meat is second hand energy. It was first processed through a plant that was eaten after. And in each level of the chain some of the energy is dissipated.

        1.1.2.3.14. Pro:
        Meat production will always be less calorie-efficient than vegetarian food production, since grain must be produced to feed meat animals.

          1.1.2.3.14.1. Con:
          While this may be true, the end product is more calorie-dense [120] in animal products than in plant products, making it a more efficient energy source to consume and thus meaning that less of it is needed.

          1.1.2.3.15.1. Pro:
          Marginal land that can't efficiently produce more than just forages can be used for feeding animals. At the same time, the manure from the animals can be used to return nutrients to the soil.

        1.1.2.3.16. Pro:
        The amount of crops (soy, corn, others) that is fed to farm animals could feed more people if directly fed to humans. Therefore, meat aggravates world hunger and veganism can contribute to ending world hunger [121].

        Because humans have been farming animals for thousands of years, many of the earths habitats that we hold precious need grazing animals to maintain them as we know them.  Grazing at the right levels maintains biodiversity and conserves many rare species of butterflies, small flowering plants etc.  If we were to remove all animals, we would also lose all of this.

        If we drastically shift from our factory farm agriculture mentality we still may be able to remediate damaged land.

        1.1.2.4.8. Pro:
        Livestock production is by far the biggest cause of land use [125], as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species.

          1.1.2.4.8.1. Con:
          Land isn't the best source of sustainable protein. 2/3s of the surface of the earth is water. Marine permaculture is a far more sustainable means of feeding high population levels. The main problem with farming practice in terms of its environmental impact, really isn't the consumption of meat, but the immoral inclinations of free markets. There are for example solutions that help resolve issues with scale, run off, green house. Free markets do not play by ethics. Same is true of agriculture.

          1.1.2.4.8.2. Con:
          It may be the biggest, but that does not make other forms of food morally superior. It makes the scale of our population and consumer needs the obvious problem. It is possible for humanity to eat any food in a sustainable way, so therefore you have failed to prove that eating meat is inherently wrong.

          1.1.2.4.8.3. Pro:
          Trees, and especially the old-growth forests, are essential to the survival of the planet's current ecosystem. Their destruction is a major cause of global warming and top soil loss.

          1.1.2.4.8.4. Pro:
          Most arable land is used to take care of livestock including feeding them; yet we don't knowingly consume most of the animal.

      A 2012 study, examining the impact of a typical week’s eating, showed that plant-based diets are better for the environment [129] than those based on meat.

        1.1.2.5.1. Pro:
        According to a 2006 report [130] by LEAD Livestock's Long Shadow, "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."

        1.1.2.5.2. Pro:
        A 2007 study concluded that "within the same method of production, a greater consumption of animal products translates to a greater impact on the environment [131]."

      1.1.2.6. Con:
      There are many things that people do that have negative impacts on the environment which we would not want to complete stop doing.  For example, farming plants and trees, mining for construction, manufacturing of consumer electronics, etc. The negative impacts on the environment of farming animals is not a sufficient reason for the contention that all meat consumption should stop.

        1.1.2.6.1. Con:
        Arguments could be made for each of those, and certainly there is a lot of work being done towards sustainable farming, mining, and manufacturing. Cutting meat out of our diets is generally easier than cutting computers out of our lives, so we start by doing what we can.

        1.1.2.6.2. Con:
        Other wrongdoings don't justify this wrongdoing. We may not be ready to abandon things like mining or tree cutting, but abandoning meat consumption is doable without negative impact in technological advancement.

        1.1.2.6.3. Con:
        This is a logical fallacy: the fallacy of relative privation. Dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world does not actually address whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument.

      1.1.2.7. Con:
      Many farm animals don't have their own native, wild habitat, and removing them from their farm habitat, by releasing them into the wild would very likely result in severe environmental, and ecological disruption. Many of these livestock would likely fail to survive in the wild, and others would likely displace existing species of plants and animals.

        1.1.2.7.1. Con:
        Sensibly winding down (animal) farming would cause far less ecological damage in the long run than continuing it indefinitely.

          1.1.2.7.1.1. Con:
          This is debatable, and there is little, if any, credible research accounting for the actual differences in ecological damage. Part of the problem being that the very notion of ecological damage is highly subjective. Another part of the problem is that we don't even know what we don't know about the actual effects of either path.

        1.1.2.7.2. Pro:
        Many semi-natural habitats have developed on and around livestock and mixed farmland. Removing these habitats would have a negative impact upon the wildlife in these habitats.

          1.1.2.7.2.1. Con:
          This presupposes sane and non-destructive non-"factory farming" methods. Much of the meat currently produced and eaten is derived from "factory farming", which is highly destructive to the environment. Ceasing to eat meat would remove the demand that drives such farming methods.

            1.1.2.7.2.1.1. Con:
            Most non-meat foods are also "factory farmed" - we cannot remove whole food groups based upon some production methods or we'd have nothing left to eat.

              1.1.2.7.2.1.1.1. Con:
              Factory farming plants, while still environmentally destructive, does not inflict suffering on animals known and proven to be capable of at least some forms of thinking.

                1.1.2.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                It does, however, inflict suffering on animals surrounding the farms. Growing up on a farm, a part of ensuring that you have enough to plant the following year often relies on killing such pests, whether or not they have any problem-solving capability.

        1.1.2.7.3. Con:
        We do not need to "release farm animals into the wild", but could create sanctuaries for them in places where they previously lived until their natural death would occur. Not only would that create jobs for those people transitioning from meat-industry jobs, but would also help make the whole transition easier for animals and humans.

          1.1.2.7.3.1. Con:
          The problem with this point of view is one of scope. How many animals? And wouldn't it simply be essentially the same process, without culling the herds as food resources?

        1.1.2.7.4. Pro:
        Animals not being used for meat could lead to overpopulation of animals. Overpopulation of animals leads to other issues for animals. The article linked points out how animal overpopulation harms the animals Why Animal Overpopulation is Harmful for Animals [132]

      1.1.2.8. Con:
      Many approaches to farming plants leads to monocultural agriculture practices that have a harmful impact on the wider environment.

        -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.5.

        1.1.2.8.2. Pro:
        This argument is highly dependent on "how" we raise animals. Many of the arguments in this thread are based on one small understanding of one single model of farming (monocultural based industrial farming). But there are other, more ecologically and productive models of raising meat. If we stay on course, your argument holds up. But if we shift to more permaculture based models of farming it does not.

          books.google.com [134]
          
          One problem here is that industrial ag dominates food production around the world. Therefore, it is a paradigm which also dominates much of the research. But, as permaculture, rotational grazing, and strategic agroecology management picks up steam, some research (and a lot of antidotal experience) is pointing to big benefits to this style of farming, including better carbon sequestering due to healthier soil.

          1.1.2.8.2.2. Con:
          How the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of the calories of plants they consume to the calories of meat they provide. Using farmed animals as a food source is inherently inefficient.

            1.1.2.8.2.2.3. Con:
            How the animals are raised does not affect the conversion ratio of organisms on different trophic levels, but it does have an impact on the overall efficiency on a farm. The claim that animals == inefficiency is a zero-sum outlook on farm production, which only holds true for certain kinds of agriculture. In systems-based agriculture an animal is one part of the system, using inputs (e.g. grass), but creating inputs for other parts of the system (e.g. manure). This can be highly efficient.

              1.1.2.8.2.2.3.1. Pro:
              In general these systems still result in net inefficiency making the point above still valid. At a very minimum, animals heat themselves, consuming energy which will never be reclaimed (by manure or otherwise), so meat will always be less efficient, though there are certainly steps that can be taken to minimize the inefficiency.

            1.1.2.8.2.2.4. Con:
            We measure those conversation ratios by burning the material [135] in question and measuring the heat outputs.  This is not a good analog for how our body processes those materials. The krebs cycle is a complex process that involves breaking and recreating chemical bonds with catalyst enzymes. Consuming all the amino acids needed to create a protein is not equivalent to consuming the protein. Protein folding is very complex and we don't fully understand how it works or the energy equations involved.

              1.1.2.8.2.2.4.1. Con:
              We know that the caloric efficiency of the Krebs cycle is somewhere around 1/3, which is very, very close to the efficiency of burning. Not surprising as chemically they are similar. In order for this point to be relevant you would need to either see a caloric efficiency for meat consumption of 1 (impossible), or animals would need to somehow convert the feed they eat at an efficiency of 1 (also impossible). If both are somehow twice as efficient, the math still doesn't work in favor of meat.

              1.1.2.8.2.2.4.2. Con:
              This may be true but we cannot rationally operate on what is not known. Ignorance is not a tool, we cannot use it to justify sweeping changes and cultural paradigm shifts. We can only operate on what we do know. Since we do not know, we cannot conclude anything one way or the other. It may indeed be better to consume meat.

                1.1.2.8.2.2.4.2.1. Con:
                There is known harm in continuing to eat meat.

          1.1.2.8.2.3. Pro:
          Permaculture based models of farming allow us to use land that wouldn't be arable for many other food products.

          1.1.2.8.2.4. Con:
          There isn't enough pasture land available even if we were to clear the wilderness in all of North America. Factory farming and feeding animals grain and fishmeal etc doesn't exist in purpose to be harmful. Like all industries, it maximizes yield and minimizes inefficiencies. It is the most efficient, and yet compared to a plant based diet is extremely wasteful.

          1.1.2.8.2.5. Con:
          It is true that the question of how we raise the animals is highly relevant. However the alternative “permaculture” would still reduce the meat production greatly (while its quality would go up) so we would still have to reduce our meat consumption.

            1.1.2.8.2.5.1. Con:
            Do means justify ends? How is not quite so relevant when the end result is still the slaughter of animals. You cannot "humanely" kill en masse.  Indeed, giving a happy life to the herd only makes the inevitable that much more heartbreaking.

              1.1.2.8.2.5.1.1. Con:
              This seems to be coming from a human-centric emotional perspective. From a utilitarian perspective - and arguably from the herd's perspective - it would indeed be better for them to have happier and more pleasant lives.

        1.1.2.8.3. Pro:
        Farming plants often has a similarly severe environmental impact. Humans no longer live in an agrarian culture where every family can farm for their own sustenance, so this ecological impact is a function of human civilization itself, not our choice of diet between plants and animals specifically.

          1.1.2.8.3.1. Con:
          If we are talking about the most efficient way to extract calories from our environment then evidence points towards plant based diets achieving this best.

        1.1.2.8.4. Pro:
        Feeding the planet on a vegetarian diet alone involves a heavy reliance on industrial monocrop agriculture.  Monocultural farms are more harmful to the environment than polycultural farms that grow a mix of plants and animals in a way that mirrors the natural ecosystem.  Polycultural farms only achieve the necessary output levels when you include the animal calories.  In terms of net animal life death, these polycultural farms cause lower loss of animal life than industrial monocultures.

        1.1.2.8.5. Pro:
        The vegetable products used to create "fake" meat protein are typically soy and wheat-based, contributing to the threat that exists due to agricultural monoculture.

          1.1.2.8.5.1. Con:
          This is still more land-efficient than feeding monoculturally-farmed plants to animals, then eating the animals.

          1.1.2.8.5.2. Pro:
          Soybean [136] agriculture spreads across South America and pressurizes the fragile ecosystems (rainforest) and its habitants.

            1.1.2.8.5.2.1. Con:
            It is a cliché that non-meat eaters eat as many soybean products as meat eaters consume meat.

              1.1.2.8.5.2.1.1. Pro:
              Most non-meateaters' meals consist of grain products, vegetables and dairy products.

                1.1.2.8.5.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                Meatless bolognese, for example, can be prepared with a variety of non-soy products like lentils, green spelt or cauliflower.

              1.1.2.8.5.2.1.2. Pro:
              Many vegetarians prefer non-soy products like seitan or lupine as meat surrogate.

            1.1.2.8.5.2.2. Con:
            -> See 1.1.2.3.8.7.

        1.1.2.8.6. Pro:
        The problem is not meat eating, but agriculture. Growing corn, soy and wheat is incredibly destructive to our environment, to the soil. Nature's only sustainable food supply is herbivores on grasslands. The herbivore stimulates grass. The grass sequesters carbon. The meat of the herbivore is nutrient dense. Human beings participated in this natural cycle for 2 million years before the industrial revolution.

        1.1.2.8.7. Pro:
        Not if done responsibly and with a particular focus on agricultural sustainability. If real farmers can take back the market from big-farma and work cohesively and symbiotically this is a very plausible potential.

        1.1.2.8.8. Pro:
        Meat animals can convert byproducts and waste that are not valuable for food into something humans can eat.

        1.1.2.8.9. Pro:
        The increasing demand for vegetables is causing deforestation in places like South America and Africaen.wikipedia.org [137]

          1.1.2.8.9.1. Con:
          Monocultural animal farming using monoculturally farmed produce uses twice the land.

        1.1.2.8.10. Pro:
        Animal agriculture contributes to an environmentally, socially and financially balanced agricultural system, with mixed feed and food crops, nutritionally diverse diets, reduced inputs and closed nutrient cycles, and a balance of operating risk from diversification.

        1.1.2.8.11. Con:
        These same monocultural practices are also used to produce food for animals, thus creating a double impact. Cutting one half of this double impact would still reduce its impact.

        1.1.2.8.12. Pro:
        The recycling of animal manures is an essential part of growing crops. The removal of this sorce of natural fertilizer would have a detrimental effect economically and environmentally on crop production and it would leave us totally dependent on artificial fertilisers.

          1.1.2.8.12.1. Con:
          Animals can be farmed for reasons other than producing meat. This would allow for animal manure (and other useful products) to be harvested without involving the many other moral and practical issues of eating meat.

            1.1.2.8.12.1.1. Con:
            To farm animals just for their manure would not be economically viable.

          1.1.2.8.12.2. Pro:
          The production of farmed vegetables works much better when associated with animal farming because the feces of the animal are an essentiel aspect of having a healthy, fertile soil to grow food on on. We do need, however, to reduce our consomption or eat animal products rather than animals themselves to reduce our environmental impact.

      1.1.2.9. Con:
      -> See 1.1.2.3.6.5.

      1.1.2.10. Con:
      There is no moral imperative for the environment to remain in stasis or for us regard it as 'fundamentally' in need of preserving so. Heat death awaits the entire universe.

        1.1.2.10.1. Pro:
        The "natural balance" was never stable, extinctions are as natural as the emergence of new species. Evolution is an ongoing process. It can be argued what the correct and moral action is for humans in any given situation, but species have been interfering with each other and forcing evolution since the beginnings of life.

        1.1.2.10.2. Con:
        Environmental damage can cause harm and suffering to both humans and other forms of life - up to and including mass extinctions [138]. Even if the environment is not naturally static, there are other reasons to avoid environmental and ecological damage.

      1.1.2.11. Pro:
      Plants can be grown in vertical farms, whereas animals cannot right now. Vertical farms use significantly less land through stacking.

      1.1.2.12. Pro:
      Vegan foods offer little waste at the end since all of it could be turned to compost. This contrasts with the by-products of meat (organs, fat, and bones) that need to be re-purposed (such as pet food) for them not to get thrown away.

        1.1.2.12.1. Pro:
        More and more animals are being killed every day. All the remains of these animals are dumped in fields or waste piles. All this killing is polluting the world.

      1.1.2.13. Con:
      All forms of modern agriculture are neither natural nor ecologically functional, as they rely heavily on monocultures, genetically modified crops [139], and chemical fertilizers.

      1.1.2.14. Pro:
      Eating meat causes human suffering, particularly in poor communities. Health problems in communities living near to animal agriculture operations and psychological problems in abbatoir workers.

      1.1.2.15. Pro:
      Current industrialized fishing is responsable for getting many species of fish and other sea animals near extinction if not extinct already, which is detrimental to ocean's ecosystem.

        1.1.2.15.1. Pro:
        The population of sea birds has fallen almost 70% from 1950 to 2010 as industrial fishing has depleted the oceans' fisheries.Seabirds suffering massive population declines [140]

      1.1.2.16. Con:
      If the impact is local, then the decision to prohibit meat eating and/or production should be local. This argument is relevant only to local policy and has no bearing on the absolute morality of meat eating and production.

      1.1.2.17. Pro:
      Avoiding eating animals will help global bio-diversity in a big way. No longer will the planet be saturated with a few breeds of cows, chickens etc.

      1.1.2.18. Con:
      Regenerative livestock farmers worldwide are responsible for rehabilitating enormous tracts of land and in some cases helping bring at risk species of wildlife back into areas. I'm yet to see many grain and veg farmers to have a similar awareness.  Stewardship with Vision [141] is just one of many such projects.

      1.1.2.19. Pro:
      There's an overpopulation of farm animals which is likely to be "the leading cause of modern species extinctions" [142]

    1.1.3. Con:
    Consumers can choose to purchase meat that is farmed in an environmentally friendly manner.

      1.1.3.1. Pro:
      Raising animals for meat using responsible pasturing practices utilizes land that cannot be farmed, improves the soil and pasture to more closely mimic native prairie, supports the livelihood of the farmers and keeps the land in question free of harmful urban development.

        1.1.3.1.1. Con:
        It's much easier for a consumer to support vegetarian alternatives than to find meat which satisfies these criteria. For example, meat is not generally labeled "raised on land that couldn't be used to grow crops for humans."

      1.1.3.2. Pro:
      Eating meat is not the reason for environmental problems, over consumption and wasted food are more likely causes.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Corporations and companies often advertise things in misleading ways, using phrases and imagery that suggests or implies one thing but really often means another. There is no guarantee that meat advertised as "environmentally friendly" actually is, the case may be that the producers only make some token efforts or use one specific strategy to be "environmentally friendly", only doing enough to legally make the claim.

      1.1.3.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.

      1.1.3.5. Con:
      Given that meat is more environmentally damaging than plants (with a few exceptions and at least in terms of CO2 production and water consumption), the choice for "environmentally friendly" farmed meat is still second-best.

    1.1.4. Con:
    "Animals" is an overly broad term which includes creatures with a high range of mental capacity/complexity. Banning the consumption of lower orders of animals is not necessarily the same as banning the consumption of high level mammals.

      1.1.4.1. Pro:
      For example, there is substantial evidence that insects cannot feel pain [143], so eating insect meat would not be immoral.

        1.1.4.1.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.2.1.6.

        1.1.4.1.2. Con:
        American culture might not easily adapt insects. They believe insects are pests to avoid rather than go to to eat. This is evidenced by the pesticide market being bigger than the insect-eating market. Although, getting rid of the "pests" by eating them might solve the "pest" problem to begin with.

        1.1.4.1.3. Con:
        There is a possibility that insects feel pain in a way that humans do not fully understand yet. People in the past thought animals did not feel pain but yet reacted to it (in a different manner) is the level we are at right now. We should not take a chance (of creating pain) in case we are wrong but instead err on the side of caution.

          1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro:
          Insects go through what looks like emotions similar to people. If an ant gets bothered enough, it seems to get angry because it moves more sporadically. When it is less threatened, it seems to calm down. If a bee feels threatened, it'll react out of what looks like fear for their life. These reactions are hard to dismiss when thinking about them having emotions.

        1.1.4.1.4. Con:
        Just because insects cannot "sense" damage, does not mean we have the right to end their lives or severely impair them.

          1.1.4.1.4.1. Pro:
          Even though they cannot feel pain, as the article mentions, they can sense damage. It is immoral to put animals through that negative sensation.

            1.1.4.1.4.1.1. Con:
            Insects can "sense" damage in that they can respond to it, but they do not feel anything. Similarly, a crude robot might be able to respond to damage, but because it cannot feel the damage, it is not morally considerable.

              1.1.4.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
              Insects are biological creatures that are living and are not robots. They should be treated as such. Just because robots act like insects does not mean they are the same thing (correlation does not equal causation)

          1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro:
          For example, if we eat a part of their body (such as legs or wings), but let them stay alive and let them live their life, their livelihood is debilitated. This reduces their chance of survival.

          1.1.4.1.4.3. Pro:
          Just because insects cannot feel pain, does not mean we should eat them. They have an important role in the ecosystem and some species are highly protected due to their endangered status. Eating them could put both of these statuses at risk.

        1.1.4.1.5. Con:
        There is a lot of new evidence that insects do have emotions. In fact, they are very similar to humans. [144]

          1.1.4.1.5.1. Pro:
          Bees get stressed out, just like humans [145].

        1.1.4.1.6. Pro:
        Eating insects is the future of meat consumption — it is easy to breed them in your own home.

      1.1.4.2. Pro:
      We should learn to eat more insects which are more ecologically friendly. There's also a lot more variety and some cultures have been doing it for millennia.

        1.1.4.2.1. Pro:
        Crickets are small enough to grow in a box. [146] A box uses much less land than livestock (which use 30% of ice-free land worldwide [147]).

        1.1.4.2.2. Con:
        -> See 1.1.4.1.2.

        1.1.4.2.3. Con:
        Eating insects are not more eco-friendly as they are part of the ecosystem and eating them will mess up the balance (aka the food web in nature).

        1.1.4.2.4. Con:
        Some insects are endangered. Eating them could make them go extinct.

      1.1.4.3. Con:
      This argument assumes that sentience is the only objection to the consumption of animal products, failing to address the issues involved with the disruption of healthy ecosystems due to the large, growing human population.

  1.2. Con:
  Ceasing to eat meat would harm the economy.

    1.2.1. Con:
    Intensive livestock farming is economically bad for small farmers.

      1.2.1.1. Pro:
      As intensive farms are highly mechanized (requiring little manual labor) their introduction into rural areas tends to reduce [148] rural employment. In the U.S., for example, the number of farm workers has dropped 80% over the past 50 years.

      1.2.1.2. Con:
      The negative effects of mass-production on smaller retailers is true of most industries, it is not particular to livestock farming.

      1.2.1.3. Con:
      Intensive livestock farming is not the only option for small farmers. They can easily specialize in alternatives, such as organic livestock farming.

        1.2.1.3.1. Con:
        It can be very costly, or economically impossible, for small farmers to change crops quickly without going bankrupt or into debt.

      1.2.1.4. Con:
      Some farms are only useful for livestock rearing. For example farms on areas of clay which cannot be ploughed. The farmers can only earn a living on small farms if they rear livestock intensively.

    1.2.2. Con:
    If the externalities of meat were properly priced in, meat production would be far less economically efficient than the production of crops.

      1.2.2.1. Pro:
      Mass produced meat is not sustainable regarding increase of CO2 and consumption of nitrogen by plants used to feed livestock. The real cost of meat is much higher [149] than the current consumer price.

      1.2.2.2. Pro:
      Meat has serious public health consequences [150].

        1.2.2.2.1. Con:
        This is caused by the quality of the meat. Imagine the meat production where the animal food is contaminated with poisons from the fertilizers and other farming products. These bad substances get into the animal meat in the fat and from there to our human bodies. The distinction between bad meat (mass farming) and good meat (grass fed free-range) must be made in order to draw health consequence conclusions. PubMed: GBHs in food. [151]

      1.2.2.3. Pro:
      Livestock farming can only be beneficial for the economy in the short term. Over the long term, the economy will be harmed by climate change induced from farm CO2 and methane emissions as well as land degradation

    1.2.3. Con:
    Whether or not something is good for the economy does not impact whether it is morally acceptable.

      1.2.3.1. Con:
      Economic harms would leave many people worse off. This is a morally relevant consideration.

        1.2.3.1.1. Con:
        Economies are not static, they can adapt and change. Where sales drop in meat products, they will likely rise in meat alternatives. Disruption could lead to more innovation and growth than traditional industries.

        1.2.3.1.2. Con:
        Conflating the biological concept of harm (meaning pain, distress, or the loss of quality of life) with economics, is a major moral error that nullifies any argument with regards to "economic harm".

      1.2.3.2. Pro:
      Harvesting human organs and reselling them would be good for the economy. This does not make it morally acceptable, and this debate centres around the morals of the action, not its economic viability.

        1.2.3.2.1. Con:
        Whether introducing an industry which is immoral might be good for the economy does not detract from the contention that stopping an established industry would be bad for the economy.

        1.2.3.2.2. Con:
        The economic impacts of stopping the consumption of meat has a moral implication under utilitarian ethics in so far as negative economic conditions have the potential to cause harm.

      1.2.3.3. Pro:
      Slavery was also once essential for economic concerns.

        1.2.3.3.1. Pro:
        "Economics" is simply the study of prices that arise from supply & demand. But morality in society determines what is allowed to be supplied or demanded. It is a major category error or a criminal fraud to pretend that because there is demand there must be supply, or vice versa. We don't think that way about offering children for sex abuse, for instance, or about nuclear fissile materials for bombs.

      1.2.3.4. Con:
      Something that is not morally acceptable for one person may be morally acceptable for another. Suggesting that eating meat is morally unacceptable completely negates human history and the fact that, at one point, we needed to sustain off of it. However, this is not to say that there aren't more humane ways to treat cattle / livestock.

        1.2.3.4.1. Con:
        Human history includes the development of morality. Immoral things, or things now considered to be immoral, were once widely accepted in the past (e.g. slavery). This does not "negate history". Therefore, it is plausible that eating meat will come to be considered immoral (by more people, and perhaps society in general) in the future.

          1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro:
          Slavery was once accepted by the society and their culture. This does not mean it is morally justified.

            1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Pro:
            Slavery, much like eating meat, involves harm to living beings which demonstrate clear preferences towards avoiding it.

        1.2.3.4.2. Con:
        Depending on the moral system used, morality can depend on the situation. Even if eating meat was morally acceptable at some points in human history, it does not necessarily follow that it is morally acceptable to continue eating it today. We are less dependant on meat than we once were, and more able to reasonably replace it.

          1.2.3.4.2.1. Con:
          The second statement is a non sequitur from the first.

      1.2.3.5. Pro:
      Slavery once was a big part of the Global Economy but was abolished even though the economic issues caused by it, there was bigger problems then just the economic part and it is the same here, there are bigger problems now, such as forest devastations, climatic effects, and the fact that we are using animals as slaves

    1.2.4. Con:
    Keynesian economic theory deals pretty well with large fluctuations in commodities.

      1.2.4.1. Pro:
      The state can boost aggregate demand in response to a fluctuation in commodities by using expansionary fiscal policy (spending more, lowering taxes, or giving cash handouts).

        1.2.4.1.1. Con:
        Spending more while lowering taxes means more debt for the next generation.

      1.2.4.2. Con:
      According to this school it means that public expenses will raise; one of the policies of Keynesian economics is to increase governmental spending.

    1.2.5. Pro:
    Ceasing to produce meat would be extremely harmful to low-income countries.

      1.2.5.1. Con:
      Factory farming fosters poverty in the Global South.

        1.2.5.1.1. Pro:
        In South Africa [152] there are clear effects of meat consumption where local communities' major source of income is replaced by factory farming they cannot compete with.

        1.2.5.1.2. Pro:
        The vast quantities of food which could feed humans is instead fed to livestock animals.

        1.2.5.1.3. Pro:
        In developing countries, intensive livestock farming obstructs [153] poverty elimination by driving local farmers out of business.

        1.2.5.1.4. Con:
        Not all meat eaters consume meat from factory farming.

          1.2.5.1.4.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.1.2.

        1.2.5.1.5. Pro:
        Meat factories create a very high demand for soybeans and corn which change the production patterns of the global south.

        1.2.5.1.6. Pro:
        Much of the world's massive hunger problems could be solved by the reduction / elimination of meat-eating, as livestock pasture needs cut drastically into land which could otherwise be used to grow food.

          1.2.5.1.6.1. Pro:
          If everyone adopted a vegetarian diet, current food production would theoretically feed 10 billion people [154] (56% more people than alive today), more than the projected population for the year 2050.

            1.2.5.1.6.1.1. Con:
            This would only be true, if also no food were wasted.

            1.2.5.1.6.1.2. Con:
            The world already produces enough food for several billions [155] more, even when eating meat.

          1.2.5.1.6.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.2.3.3.

          1.2.5.1.6.3. Pro:
          100 million people [156] could be adequately fed using land freed if Americans reduced their intake of meat by 10%.

      1.2.5.2. Pro:
      Livestock production accounts for 1.4% [157] of the world’s total GDP. The production and sale of animal products account for 1.3 billion people’s jobs, and 987 million of those people are poor.

        1.2.5.2.1. Con:
        If roughly 1B of the 1.3B people producing meat are poor we can assume they would benefit from undertaking more profitable enterprises if there were not the demand.  An economy that permits such poverty for our convenience would suggest, therefore, that eating meat is wrong.

        1.2.5.2.2. Con:
        If we would base our decisions on preserving jobs, hardly any progress could be made since any change makes a certain number of jobs obsolete.

      1.2.5.3. Pro:
      The production of farm animals provides an economic safety net [158] for many people in poor countries.

        1.2.5.3.1. Pro:
        Keeping livestock helps reduce seasonal variability [159] in food supply due to seasonal variations in crop productivity.

        1.2.5.3.2. Pro:
        Animals act as both a secure form of wealth, and as an emergency supply of food in case of shocks to the normal food supply (like droughts or famines).

        1.2.5.3.3. Con:
        The economic benefits are far outweighed by the risk to long-term health [160] and cost of potential medical expenses if the use of animals is relied on.

          1.2.5.3.3.1. Con:
          Based on the assumption that the affected people economically depend on their farm animals, a discontinuation would drastically worsen their situation and ultimately, potentially lead to undernutrition, which has a very strong negative impact on health [161], as well as on child development [162].

      1.2.5.4. Pro:
      Farmers in low-income countries are typically poor, and would not have the resources to transition to a different occupation or type of farming if they were no longer able to buy livestock.

        1.2.5.4.1. Con:
        Any significant changes in worldwide meat consumption would likely, in practice, be gradual, and allow farmers plenty of time to adjust.

      1.2.5.5. Con:
      The economies of low-income countries are particularly vulnerable [163] to climate change. Insofar as stopping meat production helps alleviate climate change, it is beneficial for the economies of low-income countries.

        1.2.5.5.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.1.

      1.2.5.6. Con:
      Low-income countries suffer from malnutrition and food shortages. Since ceasing to eat meat would allow us to produce more food, this would benefit low-income countries.

        1.2.5.6.1. Pro:
        Ending the production of meat will be necessary in order to meet the growing food needs of the world's population.

          Population growth is slowing down for last half century ourworldindata.org [164]

          1.2.5.6.1.2. Con:
          These claims fail to account for growing innovations. When problems and needs arrive, innovation to meet the demands does as well. This argument is much like Paul R. Ehrlich's, who wrote in the late 1960's The Population Bomb. Paul warned that growing population was unsustainable and the world would fall into massive starvation. However, time has proven him wrong. There is less starvation now than in the 1960's.

          -> See 1.1.2.3.

          1.2.5.6.1.4. Pro:
          Given current methods of agricultural production, the world will be unable to meet growing food demand. It is therefore urgent that we increase agricultural productivity by producing less meat.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.1. Pro:
            Agricultural land worldwide [165] suffers from soil erosion and loss of soil nutrients, which make the land unfit for future agricultural production.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.2. Pro:
            By 2050, the world will have to produce 50% more food [166] than it does now.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.3. Pro:
            Current crop yields are growing too slowly [167] to meet expected increases in food demand.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.4. Pro:
            Climate change will harm crop yields [168] by increasing global temperatures and extreme weather events.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.5. Con:
            Demographics demonstrate [169] that developed nations' birth rate are far below the replacement rate.  As countries develop, overpopulation will be a non-issue.

              1.2.5.6.1.4.5.1. Con:
              Developed nations are fueling the 3rd world and underdeveloped nation's population boom by exporting/donating food to areas that cannot sustain their current population.

              1.2.5.6.1.4.5.2. Con:
              From an ecological point of view, increased food availability for a given species, globally, results universally in an increase in species population.  Population control can only verifiably and assuredly be effected using those same ecological principles of controlling or capping a food supply to sustain x population at equilibrium or possibly a gentle, gradual rate of decrease.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.6. Con:
            There is a reasonable chance of large scientific innovations, like the Green Revolution [170], drastically boosting our agricultural productivity without necessitating the removal of meat from our diets.

              1.2.5.6.1.4.6.1. Pro:
              Indoor farming innovations have already shown that significantly reducing the footprint of agriculture is possible. large.stanford.edu [171]

            1.2.5.6.1.4.7. Pro:
            The amount of crops grown for the meat industry is not efficient. Meaning we could feed the entire population of the US with less than half the crops used to feed the animals which are then slaughtered. news.cornell.edu [172]

              1.2.5.6.1.4.7.1. Con:
              As long as our ability to produce both animal feed crops and food crops for our human population are not exceeded, this point is irrelevant.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.8. Con:
            Actually, we currently are producing enough food to feed 10 billion people (about 1.5 times or 150% as much food as we need). The problem concerning starvation is actually a food distribution problem, which is part of the reason why obesity is so endemic in areas like the USA, while people starve in other countries.

            1.2.5.6.1.4.9. Pro:
            Meat is less efficient for acquiring vitamins than it used to be [173]. This causes people to overeat foods to make up for the inadequate dietary intake, which amplifies the growing food demand.

          1.2.5.6.1.5. Con:
          There are various ways to exploit existing agricultural resources more efficiently to meet food demands.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.1. Con:
            While there are various ways to do so, reducing meat consumption is one of the most effective ones as it for example takes up most of agricultural land.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.2. Con:
            That there are various ways does not mean that reduction of meat consumption is not required.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.3. Pro:
            Mechanisms to reduce food waste could increase food production by about 1/3rd [174].

            1.2.5.6.1.5.4. Pro:
            Genetically modifying crops could increase agricultural productivity, particularly in poor countries [175].

            1.2.5.6.1.5.5. Pro:
            -> See 1.1.2.3.6.5.7.1.1.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.6. Con:
            New agricultural technologies are mostly experimental at this stage, and unlikely to be able to meet the large increases in food demand that are expected.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.7. Pro:
            Agricultural productivity has, and will continue to, increase dramatically.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.7.1. Pro:
              Historically, scientific innovations [176] have drastically increased [177] agricultural productivity.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.7.2. Pro:
              Agricultural productivity per unit of land has risen drastically [178] over the past century.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.7.3. Pro:
              Large percentages [179] of the gains in agricultural output over the last 50 years have been due to increases in the productivity of agriculture.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.8. Pro:
            There are many many solutions to this. Marine permaculture, artificial lab grown meat, insect farming. However my greater point would be this - we will face an energy crisis, a water crisis as well as a food crisis, possibly an economic crisis and likely war in the mix. It is crisis that precipitates change, either these events will produce the desirable outcome, or we will die.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.8.1. Con:
              It is possible to act proactively, and thereby avoid or reduce the severity of crises.
              
              Furthermore, other arguments made in this very debate point to ways in which the continued consumption of meat is likely to worsen the crises we may face, as it is an inefficient use of food and farmland, and environmentally damaging.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.9. Pro:
            An exclusive plant-based agriculture to feed the growing world population wouldn't be the most efficient way. Many current pasturages can't be used for the cultivation of crops.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1. Pro:
              Solutions to food shortages will need to involve meat production.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.1. Pro:
                Industrial, mono-crop agriculture is currently necessary to feed the world using only plants. Industrial agriculture is deeply environmentally harmful and we cannot continue to grow food in this way.  In order for a permaculture agriculture to match industrial agriculture's output and feed the world, animals must be a part of the system and a part of the caloric output.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.2. Pro:
                Animals are an essential part of ecological farming systems. Eating those animals is necessary for these systems to obtain the outputs required to feed the world. In order to feed the world, ecologically and sustainably, we have to eat (some) meat.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.3. Pro:
                Eating meat, such as farmed insects may be the answer to the world's protein shortage without damaging the environment.

                  1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.3.1. Pro:
                  Farmed insects do not produce meat, but incidentally contain more protein than beef and consume a minimal amounts of land, water and energy. Humans don't need meat, humans need protein.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.4. Pro:
                A recent study [180] shows that vegan diets would not provide sufficient nutrition for the current population without supplementation potentially causing disease.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.1.5. Pro:
                Many areas of the world would starve or be extremely malnourished if they stopped eating meat.World Health Organization [181]

              1.2.5.6.1.5.9.2. Con:
              Technological developments can help this, for example via vertical farming [182] which is much more area effective.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.2.1. Pro:
                The efficiency of verticle farming can be improved by incorporating aquaculture. Repurposing agricultural run-off to raise fish, and waste from fish farming to fertilize crops.

                  1.2.5.6.1.5.9.2.1.1. Pro:
                  Integrated farming is the way to go.. [183] Provides a way to grow food that has the least artificial feeds

              1.2.5.6.1.5.9.3. Pro:
              There is not enough farmable land on the planet to meet the nutritional needs of an entire population of vegetarians

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.3.1. Con:
                Previously mentioned new farming methods such as vertical farming [184] can produce greater quantities of plant-based foods without necessarily needing more land. Production capacity can theoretically be improved in any number of ways through technology, potentially up to and including space-based farming systems.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4. Pro:
              In many countries people have no choice but to eat meat cause if not they would starve, and their lands do not let plants grow up easily during a year (e.g. Greenland, Iceland, Sahara). And to transport vegetables there is quite hard and not affordable for economy.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4.1. Pro:
                The Innuit people of Greenland are unable to grow crops due to the nature of their land. Their diet consists mainly of seafood, oily fish and hunted red meat.

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4.2. Con:
                With the technology available today and the low population of such places it would be possible to grow crops indoors with minimum water consumption (hydroponics) and almost 0 energy cost (LED lights and solar panels).

                  1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4.2.1. Con:
                  Those technologies however have high capital costs; at least compared to the resources available (for sub-Saharan Africa) or the relatively small costs of international shipping (for Greenland/Iceland).

                1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4.3. Con:
                Situations where survival drives the need to eat meat are morally different from a situation where there is no need to eat meat in order to survive.

            1.2.5.6.1.5.10. Pro:
            The world produces more food than necessary. A sizable portion of all food is wasted.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.10.1. Con:
              A sizeable portion of land and plant produce is wasted on animal feed.

              1.2.5.6.1.5.10.2. Pro:
              It is estimated that 1.3 billion tons [185] of food are wasted per year. 28% of the world's agricultural land is used to produce food that is then wasted.

          1.2.5.6.1.6. Con:
          There are over 7 billion people on the planet and we are not able to responsibly care for all of them. The correct choice of action is to lessen the population to manageable sizes. Ideally, the most intelligent course of action would be to lessen the population to the point where factory farms are not needed.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.1. Pro:
            It is generally poorer countries that have expanding populations. The first world has now reached a point of stagnant population growth - even declining populations, as in the case of Japan and others. The inability of poorer countries to control their populations should not impact the lives of those in the first world. The first world having earned their luxuries and should not be denied them.

              1.2.5.6.1.6.1.1. Con:
              We are all humans, and individuals should not be unfairly privileged or disadvantaged due to the circumstances of their birth. Solutions should be implemented for the greatest good of the most humans and other living beings.

                1.2.5.6.1.6.1.1.1. Con:
                The solution that represents the greatest good for most human beings and other living beings would involve control and restriction of the population in unsustainable communities and regions.

                  1.2.5.6.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Countries that implement restrictions on populations are either communist regimes or will go through a war/civil rights period in order to make it illegal. Human beings won't allow their right to reproduction to be taken away simply because someone deems their community "unsustainable".

              1.2.5.6.1.6.1.2. Con:
              It can be debated if the first world has "earned" its luxuries, as it is built on a history of exploitation and bloodshed, and has directly or indirectly caused (and continues to contribute to) many "third world" problems.

                1.2.5.6.1.6.1.2.1. Pro:
                Such 'first world countries' have only gained most of their highly developed statuses through war and dirty politics.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.2. Pro:
            Switching to a more efficient form of food production is unlikely to prevent us from reaching a carrying capacity in the long run. Changing farming to feed a growing world population is a never-ending treadmill. Instead, we should probably focus more on the ecological stability of a system we are creating.See Jevons Paradox [186]

              1.2.5.6.1.6.2.1. Con:
              It will be beneficial and minimize damage in the short term, buying more time for and reducing the damage of finding long-term solutions.

              1.2.5.6.1.6.2.2. Con:
              Increasing efficiency of food production may reduce the amount of labour necessary for it, allowing for that labour to be potentially allocated to more progressive jobs.

              1.2.5.6.1.6.2.3. Con:
              Changing farming to feed a growing world population is only a never-ending treadmill if the population continues to grow. The vast majority of the world's population growth takes place in industrializing nations. Population growth tends to level off in post-industrial nations and although these richer nations often import large amounts of luxury food, most of them are capable of producing all the food they need. As economic development becomes more uniform worldwide, population growth will slow.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.3. Pro:
            The Earth cannot support such a growing population even if meat consumption is halted.

              1.2.5.6.1.6.3.1. Con:
              Peter Joseph's recent book "The new Human Rights Movement" maintains that the carrying capacity of the planet using vertical farming is 34 trillion. Go 27 minutes into Peter's interview with Abby Martin to hear it in his own words: www.youtube.com [187]

            1.2.5.6.1.6.4. Con:
            Non-meat food production will still make it easier for every person to be fed, and will be more efficient (less wasteful) for any given population size.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.5. Pro:
            It is not reasonable to expect every single human on the planet to change their diet.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.6. Pro:
            Yes. Eating meat is not inherently bad, because it is possible for a human population of a smaller size to eat meat at sustainable levels.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.7. Con:
            We manage to produce food for far more people than that. The problem is to transport it to them as it requires expenses and the investment does not come back --- poor countries are not able to pay for it. Through correct legislation, countries could ban supermarkets from wasting food and they would have to transport it to those in need of food, manage their supplies better, and stop trashing imperfectly shaped foods and veggies.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.8. Con:
            It is morally reprehensible to suggest the population should be reduced if you don't lead by example. Otherwise you are calling for the killing or restricted ability to procreate of others.

            1.2.5.6.1.6.9. Con:
            We absolutely have the ability to feed all of them, which can obviously be seen by the fact that we are feeding almost all of them right now, given that very few people in the world starve to death.

              1.2.5.6.1.6.9.1. Con:
              The statement that there are very few people in the world that starve to death is a gross understatement and incredibly false. Over 9 million people die from starvation per year as calculated in March of 2017. World Hunger is an epidemic.borgenproject.org [188]

          1.2.5.6.1.7. Con:
          Moderation rather than prohibition should suffice; for any population level there is, mathematically speaking, an amount of meat that can be sustainably consumed (e.g., each person eating meat twice per week might be sustainable for 7 billion people).

            1.2.5.6.1.7.1. Pro:
            From an efficacy standpoint, it might make sense to promote reduced meat consumption as a bridge instead of a cudgel toward vegetarianism. Meatless Mondays got a ton of pushback at my University - for a few weeks.

            1.2.5.6.1.7.2. Con:
            We are already way past 7 billion people today and we need to prepare the world for tomorrow. Meat production is simply a waste of nutrients we cannot afford much longer. Limiting meat production instead of forbidding it would only make it a luxury good, thus even more desirable for the masses. Countries which once had only little meat consumption already copy the western lifestyle of eating lots of meat, because it is a symbol of wealth. Meat should be a symbol of exploitation instead.

            1.2.5.6.1.7.3. Pro:
            It's not about the meat. The problem is unconscious consumerism. We eat far more meat than we need and buy far more stuff than we should. We need to look at the bigger picture instead of thinking that just ceasing to eat meat alone will solve the problem.

            1.2.5.6.1.7.4. Con:
            The practice and habit of moderation is much more difficult to follow successfully than simple abstention.

              1.2.5.6.1.7.4.1. Pro:
              As long as meat eaters retain a taste for and willingness to consume meat, there is the danger that they will end up purchasing unethically produced meat.

              1.2.5.6.1.7.4.2. Con:
              Same is true for alcohol, still most people are not alcoholics and alcohol is not banned in most countries.

                1.2.5.6.1.7.4.2.1. Con:
                This claim is self-contradictory - "most people are not alcoholics" shows that moderation is easy for alcohol. There are probably more moderate drinkers than either complete abstainers or alcoholics, so "Same [i.e., moderation is harder] is true for alcohol" is clearly false.

                1.2.5.6.1.7.4.2.2. Con:
                The discussion is about morality, not legality. A world in which no one drank alcohol would arguably be better, but it's not banned because practically trying to enforce such a ban has historically failed and lead to more problems.

              1.2.5.6.1.7.4.3. Con:
              Moderation being tougher than abstention does not imply that the latter is unfeasible.

              1.2.5.6.1.7.4.4. Con:
              Moderation stems from discipline, which can be trained [189].

              1.2.5.6.1.7.4.5. Pro:
              This study [190] found that "[Conscientious omnivores] were less likely to perceive their diet as something that they absolutely needed to follow, reported violating their diet more, felt less guilty when doing so and that these differences could in part be traced to practical and psychological factors, making it more difficult to follow conscientious omnivorism."

            1.2.5.6.1.7.5. Pro:
            The population growth is predicted to flatten out in 2100. By then there will be 11.2 billion (Page 2, figure 2) [191] people on Earth. If we reduce the consumption of beef and eat more pork, fish and chicken, then we will be fine.

            1.2.5.6.1.7.6. Con:
            Most people will make no change at all, so conscious consumers should aim for 0 meat to offset that apathy and bring the average consumption closer to what it needs to be.

          1.2.5.6.1.8. Pro:
          Meat is an unnecessary luxury food [192] in a world of food wastage [193] and localized oversupply [194].

          1.2.5.6.1.9. Pro:
          Supplies of seafood [195] and meat [196] are likely to run out in the future.

          1.2.5.6.1.10. Pro:
          We live in the 21st century and should progress out of the less civilized ways of living such as eating meat. The vegetarian movement will lead to more innovation as the meat industry ages and becomes obsolete. Humanity could advance ideas such as feeding the future population [197] and colonizing other planets [198] when moving away from meat.

            1.2.5.6.1.10.1. Con:
            Civilized people, in cultures around the world, eat meat.

              1.2.5.6.1.10.1.1. Con:
              Just because civilization have less civilized ways (such as eating meat or crime) does not mean we should accept it. We should instead work on getting rid of these actions.

                1.2.5.6.1.10.1.1.1. Con:
                You cannot compare an 'uncivilized' action such as eating meat to moral wrongdoing such as crime.

            1.2.5.6.1.10.2. Pro:
            A desire to make vegetarian lifestyles more appealing or convenient have certainly lead to some innovations in food science, such as the development of "lab-grown" meat, or various other meat substitutes. It has also advanced the development of conventional food replacement systems, such as Soylent or Huel.

            1.2.5.6.1.10.3. Con:
            The idea that eating meat is less civilized than not eating meat is a subjective value judgement, which is neither sufficiently justified here, nor widely accepted.

            1.2.5.6.1.10.4. Con:
            Evolutionary speaking, hominids only had access to meat after coming down from the trees, which means eating meat came after eating fruits and vegetables, and is therefore more civilized. Moreover, eating meat required the invention of weapons to hunt, and the discovery of fire, furthering the correlation between meat and civilization.

          1.2.5.6.1.11. Con:
          Just because something potentially becomes a problem in the future does not alone require it to stop today.

            1.2.5.6.1.11.1. Con:
            At this point it is clear that it is not only "potentially" becoming a problem, but has scientifically determined high likelihood or even certainty (if e.g. population size roughly develops as projected) of causing problems (specifically major problems) in the future. This concerns climate change[1] [199] and food production more broadly.

            1.2.5.6.1.11.2. Con:
            It is important to be cautious of future consequences when qualifying the morality of an action. The scarcity of resources in the future is a relevant implication of eating meat in this discussion.

            1.2.5.6.1.11.3. Con:
            Because of the anticipation of scarce resources in the future, we ought to begin conserving resources now by stopping meat consumption.

            1.2.5.6.1.11.4. Pro:
            There is no possible way to account accurately for how the advances of technology will be able to solve current limitations we have. You can't assume conditions will always be the same.

              1.2.5.6.1.11.4.1. Pro:
              This was a common theme back in the 1960's perpetuated by the book "Population Bomb" in which author reasoned incorrectly that the food supply would not keep up with the then current rate of population growth and everyone would have starved by now. However, because of Norman Borlaug and the "green revolution" that never occurred. Learn more about it in this video. [200]

          1.2.5.6.1.12. Con:
          The land and water supply is so low already [201] that soon we will have to find food sources that do not so heavily rely on agriculture.

            1.2.5.6.1.12.1. Con:
            This is empirically false. The article at worldwatch references United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). FAO we can see that land used for wheat, most common staple, have decreased by 25% while production has increased due to much greater yield per acre. 1986 vs 2016: www.fao.org [202]

          1.2.5.6.1.13. Pro:
          Once someone eats a plant, they can use the scraps to grow new food [203]. Regenerating food takes pressure off the food system. The same cannot be said for meat.

          1.2.5.6.1.14. Con:
          Hunger and starvation worldwide have been in decline even with a growing population until recently [204] and the recent increase is caused by war and global warming. Nothing indicates this growth to be a result of less meat production.

          1.2.5.6.1.15. Con:
          The growing food needs of the world's population can be met whether or not we stop meat production.

            1.2.5.6.1.15.1. Pro:
            How much meat to produce will be solved automatically by supply and demand. If food is scarce, prices will rise, and the most efficient forms of production will be favored.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.1.1. Con:
              Waiting for the market to adapt will cause extinctions, and massive food shortages.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.1.2. Con:
              Food shortages will primarily harm the world's extreme poor, who have very little purchasing power and are unlikely to be able to affect market trends.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.1.3. Con:
              As long as there are wealthy consumers in high-income countries willing to purchase meat as a luxury good, even food scarcity will not eliminate meat production.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.1.4. Con:
              In order for this to apply, supply needs to be limited. Right now the amazon rainforest is being cleared to make room for cattle. This is not efficient or sustainable.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.1.5. Pro:
              Historical evidence [205] validates this. 200 years ago the world population was under a billion and 95% of humans were living in "absolute poverty". Today we have a global population of 7.2 billion and only 10% of humans are living in absolute poverty. Overpopulation is a myth. It has been disproven time and time again since Thomas Malthus popularized the notion in the 18th century.
              More humans = more innovation = less scarcity.

            1.2.5.6.1.15.2. Con:
            The world's population will live in less ideal conditions by the continued production of meat products, compared to plant [206] products.

            1.2.5.6.1.15.3. Pro:
            Starvation is due to people not having access to food, as opposed to there not being enough food to go around.

              1.2.5.6.1.15.3.1. Pro:
              Globally, we currently produce a large food surplus; enough to provide for a growing world-wide population. Oxfam notes that "The world produces 17% more food per person today than 30 years ago." oxfam.ca [207]
              
              Undernourishment is therefore a problem of food distribution and waste; not reduced productivity from livestock farming.

        1.2.5.6.2. Con:
        Geographical types are different. Some places, such as mountains, are much better to keep livestock in than to grow crops.

          1.2.5.6.2.1. Pro:
          Farming animals is often the best — or only — choice available to farmers in certain areas; meaning less natural land needs to be converted to agriculture.

          1.2.5.6.2.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.2.3.6.5.14.

        1.2.5.6.3. Con:
        Adequate food is produced already and output could be increased if required. Low income countries however will have no access to it because the global economy demands payment for goods and price stability for its products so production will be controlled.

      1.2.5.7. Con:
      A lot of food produced in poorer countries is for the consumption of livestock which is then imported as meat to the west. This food could be be used to directly feed people in low income countries.

      1.2.5.8. Pro:
      The farming of animals for meat can be problematic.  For example, when the practice involves using land to produce food for animals at the expense of food for people.  However, I stayed in poor villages in Indonesia where pigs and chickens were fed scraps or scratched for grubs.  Those chickens and pigs did not take any food that was otherwise edible for people and I felt OK to eat the meat they produced.

      1.2.5.9. Pro:
      Countless small farmers make a living from raising chickens, goats and other animals for meat.  If artificial meat supplants that industry it will be just more wealth accumulating to the corporate techie elite.

      1.2.5.10. Pro:
      Many bioregions are incapable of supporting one human let alone whole societies without the use of animals as a necessary part of the foodchain.

      1.2.5.11. Pro:
      An increase in vegetarian or vegan diets could harm the economies of countries who depend heavily on their meat exports for income.

    1.2.6. Pro:
    Many people across the world depend on meat as part of their diet, and ending meat eating would lower food security/diversity for the majority of people.

      1.2.6.1. Con:
      Producing enough meat to provide the entire world's population with a meat-centric diet is not realistic or sustainable with current dominant farming models and a rising global population. Lowering meat consumption while shifting food production towards plant-based foods will give many more people around the world greater food security overall.

      1.2.6.2. Pro:
      There are parts of the world still where meat is the more readily available diet for humans than vegetable products - such as tribal Greenland where fish and seal meat are still majority sources of nutrition.

    1.2.7. Pro:
    Systems-based agricultural models are often reliant on meat production, both as an ecological service and money maker. Ceasing meat production would limit those farmers from receiving both those benefits.

    1.2.8. Pro:
    Animal agriculture is an important part of local food economies in cold climates where many crops are not available year-round.

      1.2.8.1. Con:
      New technologies can allow plant foods to grow in artificially controlled environments, for example aquaponics. It would be more energy intensive, but with the parallel rise in renewable energy, this may curtail some of the negative effects of energy intensive processes.

      1.2.8.2. Con:
      Most countries have access to global markets, and can trade non-food goods and services for food from other countries to meet any gaps on local production.

      1.2.8.3. Con:
      Traditional and contemporary methods of preserving food can be used to make sure food harvested earlier in the year is stored for the winter.

        1.2.8.3.1. Con:
        This may not be able to provide for unexpected rises in demand.

          1.2.8.3.1.1. Con:
          -> See 1.2.8.2.

    1.2.9. Pro:
    If subsidies related to farming animals were removed, the demand for meat would decrease due to higher prices and lower supply; allowing for reduction in meat consumption without a very unpopular and difficult to regulate law.

      1.2.9.1. Con:
      There are just as many subsidies for the growth of plant based foods. The same argument could be made for most foods.

      1.2.9.2. Con:
      Nobody has suggested (in this branch of the debate) outlawing eating meat, or that there should be governmental action to this effect, rather that it is an action we should take, as individuals or as a collective, out of our own free wills or moral imperatives.

    1.2.10. Con:
    In the short term, yes. In the long term not ceasing to waste land and continuing to emit massive amounts of unnecessary greenhouse gasses will incur devastating economic consequences.  Beyond this, optimizing the use of water and ending subsidies for animal agriculture would encourage inevitable growth in other sectors, something which companies like Best Foods have been compelled to accept [208] and are now making vegan mayonnaise after losing their lawsuit over eggless Just Mayo.

    1.2.11. Pro:
    Most of what we consume and buy today comes from animal production. It's not only about meat, it also concerns eggs, feathers, leather, but also candy. Stopping the production of meat will impact much more than the "Meat industry", and have a huge impact on global economy

      1.2.11.1. Con:
      Disruptive innovation can increase growth in untapped markets. Tech companies are currently making large investments in the plant based sector. Having a huge impact on the global economy is not necessarily a bad thing, for example, the internet was disruptive, but it created new opportunities.

      1.2.11.2. Pro:
      Leather products are totally dependant on meat consumption. Imagine no leather shoes, belts, jackets or shoes or bags. Other industrial products like fertilizers come from recycled waste products. Then imagine the impact of shutting down the interconnected industries and the loss of jobs and taxes for what?

        1.2.11.2.1. Con:
        There are plenty of plant based or synthetic alternatives to animal materials.

        1.2.11.2.2. Con:
        "Imagining the impact" of these changes is speculatory at best, and does not speak on the core ethics of killing animals for food or materials.

      1.2.11.3. Con:
      Modern economics teaches [209] that supporting production for production's sake (protectionism) is economically harmful, because it takes labor and resources away from production for consumption's sake.

    1.2.12. Con:
    Living beings should not be treated as commodities. It would be considered to be dehumanizing if applied to humans, and I believe similar emotional disconnection and distancing even from animals is a bad idea which leads to undesirable results (abuses, desensitization to all harm including that done to humans, etc.).

    1.2.13. Con:
    The economic impact may be manageable - it would not be the first time an industry has wound down, or been shut down or suppressed.

      1.2.13.1. Pro:
      Meat and the meat industry would simply be replaced with the production of vegetarian foods, meaning the effects on the economy would be minimal.

        1.2.13.1.1. Pro:
        Stopping meat production would come along with an increasing production of substitutes, such as vegetables, crops and fruits. This creates new livelihoods for farmers.

          1.2.13.1.1.1. Con:
          Experts in animal farming may have no relevant knowledge to put toward agricultural farming. Rather than creating new livelihood for these farmers, it would force them to rapidly become experts in an entirely new field with no time for transition.

            1.2.13.1.1.1.1. Con:
            This would not be the first time an industry has been made redundant and workers in that industry have had to retrain.

          1.2.13.1.1.2. Con:
          The animals currently used to farm meat will not disappear overnight. In order to immediately transition to agricultural farming, all of those animals would need to be slaughtered to make room for the vegetation. Not only would this be cruel to the animals, but it would also destroy the farmers' finances.

        1.2.13.1.2. Con:
        Agricultural production as of today is already sufficient to cover the demand for the world. Thus, no substitute is needed and no new jobs created.

          1.2.13.1.2.1. Pro:
          The world already produces enough food for several billions [210] more.

          1.2.13.1.2.2. Con:
          Agricultural production today is not sustainable due to destructive techniques that deplete the quality of the land.

        1.2.13.1.3. Con:
        It is extremely difficult to transition from farming meat to farming normal agricultural products, and the transitionary period would cause drastic economic harms.

          1.2.13.1.3.1. Con:
          Other land use changes could be considered, for example, returning farmland to natural habitat and gaining revenue from recreational activities.

        1.2.13.1.4. Pro:
        Other food production sectors would grow, meaning companies would require additional human capital to meet the new demand. As such, any jobs lost in the meat industry would simply appear in other food sectors.

      1.2.13.2. Pro:
      Cultural and technological changes cause economic shifts all the time. Products and whole industries become obsolete or unacceptable. Societies and economies adapt to these changes.

        1.2.13.2.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.3.3.

        1.2.13.2.2. Pro:
        Industries are constantly growing and dying - they evolve with consumer demand. Though there may be additional capital involved in switching from farming animals to farming plant-based products, farmers would make the change to ensure that their crop business remain lucrative. No-one uses floppy disks or rides to work on a horse anymore. Similar principles apply here.

      1.2.13.3. Pro:
      The meat substitutes industry can grow to replace the meat industry, taking jobs from the meat industry and creating new ones.

      1.2.13.4. Pro:
      We have examples of economic shift working already. In the dairy industry, for example. There are less people drinking milk now, which has caused the plant-milk and other non-dairy industries to flourish.

      1.2.13.5. Pro:
      It can be compared with the need to lower the depencency of fossil fuel - in the short term there may be negative consequences, but in the longer term, the advantage clearly outweighs the disadvantages

    1.2.14. Con:
    This is an advantage as financial pressure is a force for change.

    1.2.15. Pro:
    Breeding livestock is necessary for many people (particularly farmers) to survive. Stopping this will eliminate their foundation of life.

      1.2.15.1. Con:
      -> See 1.2.13.1.1.

      1.2.15.2. Con:
      Meat production is economically irrelevant in most national economies. Thus, impacts on farmers are easy to mitigate.

        1.2.15.2.1. Pro:
        In advanced economies agriculture [211] in general is not very important. Meat production is therefore even more unimportant.

        1.2.15.2.2. Pro:
        In underdeveloped countries meat production is marginal as illustrated by the low rates of meat consumption.

          1.2.15.2.2.1. Con:
          More than half [212] of all employment in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is in the agricultural sector; in many of them, this produces more than a third of the national GDP.  About one third [213] of the production in this sector is livestock.

          1.2.15.2.2.2. Con:
          Meat production in Uganda plays a significant role for the national  and rural economy. Beef production alone stands at 145000 Mt [214].

        1.2.15.2.3. Con:
        For countries like Argentina and Uruguay, around three quarters [215] of their exports consist of frozen meat.

          1.2.15.2.3.1. Con:
          In Argentina, animal agriculture is leading to deforestation and huge losses of natural capital which has a negative impact on citizens in the long term: www.argentinaindependent.com [216]

      1.2.15.3. Pro:
      Not eating meat means not farming animals, not farming animals means no money to feed them, no money to feed them means no more cattle, chicken, pigs, etc. as long as we live in a capitalist system/economy.

        1.2.15.3.1. Con:
        This may be a benefit, as human-raised livestock is often kept in atrocious conditions, and also has negative environmental impacts. Farming also has negative impacts on humans.

          1.2.15.3.1.1. Pro:
          The meat industry has harmful effects on the physical and mental health of its workers. Eradication of this industry would reduce these harms.

            1.2.15.3.1.1.1. Pro:
            Eating meat has negative impacts on worker safety [217]. Meatpacking workers are injured at a rate of 27.6 per 100 workers - double the average of all manufacturing industries.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              Human Rights Watch [218] has called meatpacking "the most dangerous factory job in America".

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.2. Con:
              The meatpacking industry can be dangerous, but the solution for improving the safety of slaughterhouse workers is the strengthening of workplace safety rules, and increasing the monitoring of factories for safety violations.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.3. Con:
              Safety in the US meat industry has increased drastically since the early 1990s [219].

                1.2.15.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                That does not mean it is still not the most dangerous industry out there.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.4. Con:
              The source cited refers to poultry but in other branches of the meat industry safety standards are very high and injuries in the US decreased from 20% to 6% [220] in 2012.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.5. Pro:
              Health problems for workers is negative [221] for the national economy at large and only profitable to the individual firm.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.6. Pro:
              Meatpacking companies often stop workers from getting compensation [222] for workplace injuries by denying or delaying complaints and not filing reports about injuries.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.1.7. Pro:
              The low wages and benefits on meatpacking workers makes the injuries hard to treat.

            1.2.15.3.1.1.2. Con:
            Workers in other food producing industries do not fare any better than workers in the meat industry.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.2.1. Pro:
              Fruit and vegetable picking is an extremely low paid [223] and very hard job.

                1.2.15.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                Young Europeans on a gap year finance their trip by fruit picking [224] in, for example, Australia. It therefore cannot be so hard as to discourage those travellers.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.2.2. Con:
              Slaughterhouse workers have to kill living creatures on a daily basis, which has been proven to cause severe psychological and physiological stress or PTSD [225] (pp. 20-25), no matter whether the worker started the job knowing what it entailed.

            1.2.15.3.1.1.3. Pro:
            Working on a fishing boat is a very hard and dangerous job and ranks second [226] most deadliest in the US.

            1.2.15.3.1.1.4. Pro:
            The meatpacking industry is made particularly hazardous [227] due to a lack of training being provided to workers, close working quarters and insufficient safeguards.

            1.2.15.3.1.1.5. Con:
            This is a problem that should be solved through regulation of workplace conditions or temporary boycotts, not permanently ceasing to eat meat.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1. Con:
              There is nothing that can be done to prevent the need for carrying out certain psychologically and physically harmful tasks inherent to the meat industry: the killing of the animal by a human hand, for example, is inevitable, whatever workplace regulations are put in place.

                1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con:
                Animal slaughter can be mechanized.

                  1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con:
                  Both Halal [228] (Islamic) and Shechita [229] (Jewish) laws surrounding the proper slaughter of meat would be likely to prohibit [230] mechanised slaughter due to the rules surrounding who is fit to slaughter and how the slaughtering must occur.

                    1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    The Halal and Shechita presence on the Western meat market is expanding [231]; for example, Halal meat now comprises approximately 25% of the entire UK meat market, in comparison to 11% in 2001. Halal and Shechita methods therefore affect a significant (and growing) percentage of livestock destined for slaughter.

                1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2. Con:
                The people who work in slaughterhouses likely do not care about killing animals, so employing them to do that is not mistreating them.

                  1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con:
                  -> See 1.2.15.3.1.1.2.2.

                  1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.2. Con:
                  Studies [232] have shown that working in animal slaughterhouses leads to desensitisation to suffering and violence in general: abattoir workers have aggression levels comparable to those of incarcerated people, and towns with abattoirs have higher rates of domestic violence and violent crimes including murder and rape. This suggests not only that the meat industry harms worker psychology, but that it indirectly harms the wider human population as well.

                    1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.2.1. Con:
                    It must also be considered that cause and effect could be reversed here. There could be many people with violent tendencies or desires who work in slaughterhouses in an attempt to give that violence a safer outlet.

                      1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                      Regardless of this, it is still possible that working in slaughterhouses could exacerbate pre-existing violent tendencies.

                        1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                        One would have to avoid empathizing with the animals they must slaughter in order to avoid emotional pain when working in a slaughterhouse, which would likely involve avoiding or minimizing empathy entirely - which would in turn reduce one's empathy with other human beings and make one more likely to commit crimes or inflict violence against them.

                        1.2.15.3.1.1.5.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro:
                        Inflicting violence or wounds on animals is desensitizing to violence and wounds in general, as previously mentioned.

                    Facilities regarded as undesirable to live near - such as abattoirs, power stations or prisons - are often built in locations that are already run-down and have a higher level of crime, thus these studies could say little about the true effect of slaughterhouses on local violent crime.

                      Maybe facilities are built there because only those areas accept and support the practices of slaughterhouses. The situation is similar to the industries the US brought overseas because they could not accept the conditions they create (such as leather tanning, clothing, or electronics).

            This claim is a generalization. It is impossible to claim that the meat industry as a whole is harmful to its workers. Some companies may be harmful to its workers, but to apply this characterization to all companies in the meat industry is not logically sound.

              1.2.15.3.1.1.7.1. Pro:
              This claim depends on an assumption that eating meat of any kind only supports large-scale meat production. There are many sources of meat that do not fit that description, and among those sources, harm to workers compares very well with peer operations in sustainable agriculture.

                1.2.15.3.1.1.7.1.1. Con:
                Unless the demand for meat changes or several hundreds of thousands more small meat companies start a new business and remain stable, large-scale meat production will remain the primary means of meat production.

              Industrial livestock farming might not replicate the natural environment of animals, yet it is an expression of the food chain in which humans dominate these animals. In this sense, it is quite natural.

                1.2.15.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con:
                Food chains are merely descriptive, not deterministic. If we were to eat other humans today, our food chain would reflect that - but by no means prescribe or justify that we eat other humans. To argue that we have to eat meat due to our position in the food chain is thus a circular argument.

                1.2.15.3.1.3.1.3.2. Con:
                Food chains are not naturally given but socially constructed. Hence, some people see it as perfectly natural to not eat animals, for example some Buddhists for whom this would go against the foundations of their world view [238].

              Laws in states such as the UK require that animals be stunned [242] before being killed, so as to be totally unconscious (and thus incapable of feeling pain) at the time of their slaughter.

                These same laws around pre-stunning do not apply to Shechita (Jewish) and Halal (Muslim) slaughter of animals for meat, whose methods [243] usually involve cutting the animal’s throat with a very sharp knife, often without pre-stunning.

                  1.2.15.3.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  The 2013 report released by the UK's Food Standards Agency reveals that of the animals killed by Shechita or Halal methods, a relatively small proportion [244] were slaughtered without stunning (p. 4).

                  Shechita slaughter methods cause an instant drop in blood pressure in the brain that immediately results in irreversible loss of consciousness [245] (p. 3). Thus, despite not pre-stunning, Shechita does not result in more animal suffering than other methods.

              1.2.15.3.1.3.5.1. Con:
              This sentience is momentary and ephemeral [258], thus should not interfere in animals' ability to predict death and retain recent events. Parenthood problems could, therefore, be avoided by sedating and giving more "humane" treatment to animals.

              This is a biological response rather than emotional. Mother cows udders become full of milk when the calf is removed, and the mother is looking for her calf simply for relief. The same is true of removed calves calling for their mothers for milk. Once the calves begin to eat solid food they stop searching for the mother, and once the mothers' milk production stops they stop searching for their calves.

            Many meat producing companies use misleading titles like "Cage Free" and "Free Range" to make buyers feel better. Meanwhile instead of having individual cages that barely allow for movement, animals are crammed into huge pens where they often are so close that they bump into each other constantly.

            1.2.15.3.1.3.11. Con:
            This claim depends on examples of treatment that is cruel.  Many of the examples of farming practices viewed as cruel serve a function that benefits the animal's well being.  For instance calves are separated from their mother at birth because we are able to prevent infections better while they increase antibodies, killing is necessary but pain free, animals are restrained, but in many cases are free to exhibit normal social behavior. Producers know that reducing stress increases output.

    Meat keeps food prices high (due to supply and demand). With meat taking resources, such as land and water, the food supply is limited for consumers, which pushes the prices higher for food. This is good for the economy because if food prices go too low, farmers run into difficulties covering their costs. [267]

      1.3.2.2. Pro:
      Thanks to un-natural means such as modern medicine the lifespan of humans has increased tremendously [283]. The lifespan of our closest primate relatives, who are presumed to live a natural lifestyle, is merely half [284] of ours.

        1.3.2.2.1. Pro:
        Only through the development and wide-spread use of medical inventions, such as vaccinations, was it possible to protect humans from or even eradicate various naturally occurring infectious diseases.

          1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro:
          Until the Mid-20th century it was natural for millions to suffer from smallpox, many of whose victims went blind and died. The disease was responsible for 300 to 500 million deaths [285] in the 20th century - but was successfully eradicated [286] through the use of vaccinations by 1980.

          1.3.2.2.1.2. Con:
          Vaccines are based on parts of the bacteria or the virus that make up a disease. In this sense, the working ingredient of vaccines is actually natural [287].

            1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
            "Unnatural" steps are required for their production, such as interfering with disease cells to create vaccines.

          1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro:
          The wide-spread use of unnatural vaccines was able to decrease the worldwide cases of Polio by 99% [288] since 1988: From 305.000 to 74.

          1.3.2.2.1.4. Con:
          Vaccines work through a natural mechanism [289] and merely provoke the human immune system to produce its own, perfectly natural anti-bodies to viruses and diseases.

      1.3.2.3. Pro:
      Glasses, wheelchairs, and other such inventions have greatly added to the quality of life of those nature would leave in a quite poor position.

    1.3.3. Con:
    Buying and consuming processed meat from intensive livestock farming is anything but natural.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.2.15.3.1.3.1.

      1.3.3.2. Pro:
      We may only talk of a 'natural' process when observing the ways of indigenous tribes such as the Inuit, who hunt and prepare their meat themselves, and do not over-consume or waste their prey. The majority of humankind today do not share these same, natural practices.

      1.3.3.3. Con:
      -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.1.

      1.3.3.4. Pro:
      Meat requires preservatives [290] so it does not spoil.

      1.3.3.5. Con:
      -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.4.

      1.3.3.6. Pro:
      Chaffing male chickens right after their hatching is anything but natural.

      1.3.3.7. Pro:
      Carnivores have a place in the ecosystem, but the human practice of eating domestic meat does not satisfy the requirement of ecological benefit and therefore becomes harmful at scale.

      1.3.3.8. Con:
      The potential of human's progress has already been there from the very beginning, like the potential of a flower is already in its seed. So how humans live today is the real natural way, not the underdeveloped states before.

        1.3.3.8.1. Con:
        That indicates that evolution would stop now and humans are standing at the peak of their development. But humans have not stopped evolving [291]. Therefore every state of human development is natural - in the past, now and in the future.

        1.3.3.8.2. Con:
        While the flower has no other option than growing out of the seed and becoming only one specific flower (a proper watering, etc. assumed) humans have a broader variety to decide what kind of human being they want to become.

          1.3.3.8.2.1. Con:
          From a deterministic [292] point of view, every human action and choice is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature. Therefore the "path" they allegedly chose is determined as well and not a product of their consciousness.

            1.3.3.8.2.1.1. Pro:
            Assumed there is an absolute freedom [293] of human action (and choice), it requires the randomness of absolute unpredictability, but if the individual's actions are the direct consequence of a random event, it cannot feel responsible for it.

            1.3.3.8.2.1.2. Con:
            Humans always have the option to kill themselves and therefore deny any (determined) path for themselves.

              1.3.3.8.2.1.2.1. Con:
              Heavily mentally disabled and physically handicapped people do not have this option.

                1.3.3.8.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                Heavily mentally disabled and physically handicapped people are very special cases, which usually are not taken into consideration when talking about general abstract topics.

              1.3.3.8.2.1.2.2. Con:
              The wish to end one's life is a product of a chain of random events the individual is not responsible for.

                1.3.3.8.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
                That would make the whole concept way too much of a vague idea, which could be (and maybe is) used for nothing but relativism.

          1.3.3.8.2.2. Con:
          Consciousness is merely a result of physical material interactions [294]. The brain is a system whose operation is governed by the laws of chemistry and physics, thus all of our thoughts, emotions and decisions are produced by natural reactions and not, as we like to think, by individual decision.

    1.3.4. Pro:
    The brain's circuits are designed to generate behaviour that is appropriate to our survival. Generally, beings find things tasty that their system needs, as the brain tells them unconsciously [295]. Thus we can conclude: meat tastes good because it is useful.

      1.3.4.1. Con:
      This does not explain why many people find products such as alcohol, tabacco or drugs (that are not necessary nor useful for our body, but rather harming) tasty.

        1.3.4.1.1. Con:
        In general, people do not find these substances to be tasty in the same way as food, (see: flavored tobacco, mike's hard lemonade) rather, they enjoy the effect that these substances have on them.

        1.3.4.1.2. Pro:
        People also find foods high in fat and sugar tasty, but this 'natural tendency' of ours is causing rising numbers in ilnesses, such as diabetes. The fact something is tasty, does not mean it is generally good for us. The same goes for foods filled with artificial flavours. They generally taste good, but might not provide us with the right nutrients.

          1.3.4.1.2.1. Con:
          Artificial flavours are not an applicable argument here, as they are deliberately designed to be "tasty" no matter their actual composition, and thus to "trick" our brains and "natural tendencies".

      1.3.4.2. Con:
      Just because something is useful does not mean that it is necessary in any way.

        1.3.4.2.1. Pro:
        Cutlery is useful, but not strictly necessary to eat food. We could instead use our fingers.

      1.3.4.3. Con:
      Our brains evolved at a time when food was scarce and we needed to maximise our intake or we would not survive. Thus it incentivised us to consume food rich in nutrients; an instinct that is no longer necessary.

        1.3.4.3.1. Pro:
        We crave high calorie foods, in particular, foods with high sugar and salt content. businessinsider.com [296] These resources were rare and beneficial to survival

          1.3.4.3.1.1. Pro:
          However, in today's society, excessive consumption of them can lead to health issues.

        1.3.4.3.2. Pro:
        That humans are designed to enjoy food that is good for you comes from a time when humans needed a completely different diet and high protein or energy foods were scare. For example, Oreos are delicious but not necessarily good for ones diet.

      1.3.4.4. Con:
      The quality of "tasty" is a fluid concept based more on the idea of appetitive and aversive taste stimuli [297]. Indeed, while appetitive tastants (e.g. sugar, salt, umami) signal calorie-rich foods the organism should consume, high concentrations of these tastants can actually become aversive [298].

      1.3.4.5. Con:
      Just because our sensory systems convey that meat is good (i.e. pleasurable), that doesn't mean that we can extrapolate [299] that it's morally "good" to eat meat.

        1.3.4.5.1. Pro:
        Rape is morally abhorrent, but still physically pleasurable for the perpetrator.

    1.3.5. Con:
    Just like other conceptions of what is natural, the idea of eating meat as being natural is socially constructed and subject to change.

      1.3.5.1. Pro:
      Humans have abandoned or modified behaviours that were once considered natural.

        1.3.5.1.1. Pro:
        Sexual intercourse was naturally meant as a means of reproduction. But humans have managed to invent a variety of safe sex methods and even birth control.

        1.3.5.1.2. Pro:
        Humans in industrial nations have overcome the "hunting" part of stone-age culture; there is no reason why they should not outgrow the "consumption of meat" part as well.

          1.3.5.1.2.1. Con:
          Hunting in industrialised nations is no longer necessary for the acquisition of food.

        1.3.5.1.3. Pro:
        It was once deemed natural to eat with one's bare hands, but humans went on to invent utensils to eat instead.

          1.3.5.1.3.1. Con:
          The means by which people eat does not change what people eat. It's a very distinct behavioural change that is not comparable with that of changing the human diet entirely.

        1.3.5.1.4. Pro:
        There are many things that are currently or were once considered "natural" that humans have ceased doing or have put limits on. For example, sex is natural yet there are obvious legal and cultural restrictions surrounding who, when, where, and how we can have sex. It is in human nature to hurt and kill each other, yet it is is illegal and immoral to do so in 99% of these instances. Wearing clothing is not natural, yet we do so. Bottom line: Culture, nature, and morality are often in conflict.

      1.3.5.2. Con:
      That ancestors ate meat is an evidence proven fact and no social construction.

        1.3.5.2.1. Con:
        Our ancestors equally raped and pillaged - yet this is generally not seen as natural behavior. What counts as natural is thus a social construction.

        1.3.5.2.2. Pro:
        Scientists [300] have predominantly found traces of meat on neanderthals' teeth, proving they had a meat-heavy diet.

      1.3.5.3. Pro:
      A study [301] looking into the reasons for individuals' 'Environmentally Significant Consumption' found that social structural factors, macro-economic structure and psychological factors can all offer an explanation of the meat (or lack thereof) consumption patterns of individuals.

      1.3.5.4. Con:
      Something is natural if it occurs in nature, without modern human interference. Its definition never changed and is certainly not a human construct.

        1.3.5.4.1. Con:
        A definition is a meaning attributed to something by humans, so must be a construct as such. Definitions for abstract things, such as "natural", are thus surely nothing more than arbitrarily delineated human constructs and are indeed subject to change over time.

      1.3.5.5. Con:
      The digestion of meat and the absorption of its many nutrients, are not social constructs.

        1.3.5.5.1. Pro:
        The human body is not a social construct, it is a biological construct. The digestive system is not designed to eat a fibrous diet, it is designed to eat meat. Nutrition and Degeneration by Weston A Price - the study of indigenous eating habits [302]

      1.3.5.6. Pro:
      Arguing that eating meat is human nature and inherent to humanity is the "appeal to nature" fallacy. yourlogicalfallacyis.com [303]

      1.3.5.7. Con:
      The consideration of the superiority of any diet, including a meatless one, is equally a construct.

    1.3.6. Pro:
    Meat has historically been both valuable for our technological progression, and necessary to continued human existence, it is not clear that that value has ended.

      1.3.6.1. Pro:
      Without meat we probably would have died, which would have hindered our advancement greatly.

      1.3.6.2. Pro:
      Our development of cooling technology has centered around the preservation of meat.

      1.3.6.3. Pro:
      Bone is a good material that we used to make our early tools.

        1.3.6.3.1. Con:
        We do not still use bone tools. The opening statement is not "we should never have eaten meat", but "we should stop now".

      1.3.6.4. Pro:
      Animal skins are an effective source of protective clothing.

      1.3.6.5. Con:
      Replacements for much of its value to survival are available, as per the study of nutrition.

      1.3.6.6. Con:
      Attempting to minimize the presence of meat in our diets, or remove it from them, would also drive technological progression.

      1.3.6.7. Pro:
      Our ancestors ate meat, allowing them more free time (away from agriculture) and thus allowing our early technologies to blossom.

      1.3.6.8. Con:
      There are ancient vegetarian tribes, such as Etyottydaih [304]. Eating meat was not an important cultural component for all ancient human tribes.

    1.3.7. Con:
    Being that we're classified as omnivores, consuming meat would best be described as functional and significant, but not "central" to our existence.

    1.3.8. Con:
    There are many other things which could be argued to be "a central part of human nature and biology and thus inherent to humankind" which we do not (continue to) do.

      1.3.8.1. Pro:
      Eating [305] insects is equally part of human nature but was abandoned by some parts of humanity.

        1.3.8.1.1. Con:
        When humans left Africa and lived in snowy, glaciated Europe about 250,000 years ago, there were no insects to eat, they were forced to abandon [306] it. It was not an aware and intentionally made decision compared to stop eating meat nowadays.

        1.3.8.1.2. Con:
        Even if some humans choose not to eat insects, doing so is still ethical because it is part of human nature.

      1.3.8.2. Pro:
      Historically, many behaviours could have been considered "a central part of human nature and thus inherent to humankind" yet are now considered abhorrent and forbidden, such as murder for resources on an individual level.

      1.3.8.3. Pro:
      Following that line of thought we could also say that violence, murders, rapes, and man's exploitation by man are all a central part of human nature. But this doesn't explain why they should be considered as right or wrong.

    1.3.9. Con:
    As a vegetarian diet can satisfy our nutritional needs, there's no need for most humans to eat meat.

      1.3.9.1. Pro:
      While meat is considered a tasty source of protein, there are many vegetarian dishes around the world that are comparably protein-dense and delicious.

        1.3.9.1.1. Pro:
        Dishes based on tofu [307], a common meat substitute, are also protein-dense.

      1.3.9.2. Con:
      Many plant-based foods do not naturally have enough vitamin B12 [308] for a healthy diet, so many vegetarians must take supplements to remain healthy.

      1.3.9.3. Pro:
      Not only is it impossible to say that enjoying the taste of meat is universal but for many the thought of animal suffering accompanies the act and undermines any potential for "pleasure" to be derived from it.

        1.3.9.3.1. Pro:
        Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.

          1.3.9.3.1.1. Con:
          Plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.

            1.3.9.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Plants are not comparable to humans in the way that animals are.

              1.3.9.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              Plants react merely to outside stimuli, such as sunlight or mineral composition, rather than having sentient preferences that can be described as interests.

                1.3.9.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The combination of two arguments from Singer–his 'equal consideration of interests,' and his take on 'minimal standard of decency–' allow for all organisms interests to be considered. Even inorganic matter may be considered equally as having 'interests' beyond their usefulness to me. 'Consideration' is requisite to evaluate my choices as an individual. Given that our understanding of sentience exists on a changing spectrum, what I choose to consume ideally reflects a minimal standard of decency.

                1.3.9.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                "Sentient preferences", are also merely a reaction to outside stimuli, even if it is more complex.

              1.3.9.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              Animals and humans have individual interests and behaviours which vary from person to person and animal to animal. By contrast, plants all have the exact same, static interests. This is a morally relevant difference between the two groups.

              1.3.9.3.1.1.1.3. Pro:
              Plants are very different from humans and animals in that they are alive but they are not sentient [309], which makes killing them less of a concern.

              1.3.9.3.1.1.1.4. Pro:
              Humans and animals are indistinguishable, for they are part of the primate group (family of the great apes [310]), thus humans are animals [311] as well.

                1.3.9.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con:
                This argument is just as flawed as saying every human on Earth is indistinguishable for we all belong to the same taxonomy.

              1.3.9.3.1.1.1.5. Con:
              All life forms are comparable. They all have various sets of reactions to various stimuli, which include emotions, that are also only a reaction to outside stimuli.

            1.3.9.3.1.1.2. Pro:
            Research has suggested that plants are very aware of the world around them [312] and therefore know when they are ripped  and know the difference between hot and cold touch.

          1.3.9.3.1.2. Con:
          Humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.

            1.3.9.3.1.2.1. Con:
            There is no logical connection [313] between our current position in the food chain and the justifiability of eating animals. Such a reasoning is circular because what puts animals on a lower level than us is eating them.

              1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1. Con:
              What puts animals on a lower level in the food chain (and what maintains humans at the top) are the cognitive, motor and social capabilities of the human species.

                1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                We have used these superior capabilities to create advanced technology [314], thereby giving us tools that help us to hunt or rear animals. This places us at the top.

                  1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Most people have no idea [315] how to hunt, rear animals, or make the necessary tools. Based on this argument it would thus make no sense to say that such a person is “at the top of the food chain”.

                    1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    Because of the structure of human societies with division of work and other principles, not every human needs those skills. This becomes even more the case the more advanced the technology gets.

                1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con:
                The evolutionary advance of the human species gives them the skill to reason and enables them to rethink their behavior. It lets them decide to not kill animals for food anymore - no matter if there is a right to kill and eat any animal.

                  1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                  Unlike other animals, humans are morally conscious of their behaviour and are thus subject to moral standards [316], meaning they cannot justify meat consumption on the basis of (arguments such as) convenience or their own mental superiority.

                    1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    Simply stating that humans should be morally conscious does nothing to argue that eating meat is morally wrong.

                      1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      Moral behaviour would likely not include being complicit in the slaughter of animal life for food.

                    1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
                    The normalizing of killing animals for food leads to a close-minded population less able to feel empathy and emotions for other species.

                      1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
                      Empathy is subjective [317]; our response to stimuli like these can be modified easily.

                      1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
                      Humans feel empathy for their pets.

                        1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro:
                        Since humans feel empathy for their pets, it can not be true that killing animals completely closes our minds, or inhibits our ability to empathize, even with non-human entities.

                        1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.2. Con:
                        Cognitive dissonance is a result of this. We feel only what we want to feel, because the truth makes us uncomfortable.

                      1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con:
                      It has not been shown that animals have emotions with which to empathize; humans should thus be reciprocal in how they consider other creatures.

                        1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
                        Many animals will act distressed when either a human or another member of their species they care for dies, and many pets have saved their owners' lives.

                      1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro:
                      Care for animals and nature is necessary for human survival on this planet in a natural way.

                        1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con:
                        Our societies are slowly becoming less 'natural'; you don't need empathy to survive as a species

                      Keep in mind humans have been eating meat a lot longer than that, and if your argument is true the issue is already lost, since the close-minded human population already cannot feel emotions.

                    The uniqueness of humanity lies in its ability to reason beyond the forces of entropy and past the constraints of an impulse for survival. Humanity has for the most part conquered survival, and we continue to conquer the vices with which we were born as we progress towards something of a species to be proud of. We must undo these obsolete desires for pleasure as they come at the cost of life. It is in our power, our moral beliefs, and our logical perspective of life as humans to do so.

                Brain size doesn't necessarily mean more intelligence. The sperm whale for instance has a brain that weighs 17 lbs on average [345], where a normal humans is 3 lbs. That doesn't mean sperm whales are smarter than humans.

                    There is considerable ongoing debate on what markers of intelligence are important. The current strong candidate is brain wrinkling. There is behavioural evidence to suggest classes of more advanced species. For example, higher mammals such as dolphins and elephants display what appears to be funeral/burial behaviours. Other higher mammals such as other primates display adaptive problem solving. There is some evidence that elements of pain perception do relate to evolutionary advancements.

              1.3.9.3.1.3.2.3. Con:
              The basis of this argument is fundamentally wrong. Whenever something is placed on a scale of "closeness" to something else, based on what is used, there will always be something closer than other things. It doesn't definitively mean that one comes from, or is related to the other.

                Our hubris, ironically, is exactly that element which differentiates us from the rest of the animal kingdom and leads to our technological, ethical, and logical advancements beyond the rest of the animals.

              1.3.9.3.1.3.3.4. Pro:
              Speciesism, like sexism and racism, is thinking that we as human are a superior species which leads us to slave, abuse and kill "inferior" beings. Nowadays we have advanced toward a more accepting and tolerant world and therefore we can assume that in the next 10-15 years there will be a prohibition to eat meat much like there is a prohibition to smoke in public places.

              1.3.9.3.1.3.3.5. Pro:
              Killing animals for food, clothing, experimentation or any other reason directly enforces the idea of violence perpetuated by the strong upon the weak. It is similar to how all marginalized sections of society were and still are treated. Racism, ableism, sexism, homophobia - they are all directly related to carnism.

              Rationally, there is no clear moral difference between a human's interests and a non-human animal's. If we are to try and justify human rights, we will see that we are unable to come up with a criterion which includes humans but excludes other animals. Sentience is the ultimate reason we think of it as wrong to harm humans; people feel pain. It is morally arbitrary to say other animals should not get the same consideration simply because they are not humans.

            1.3.9.3.1.3.4. Con:
            Humans are superior to all other animals, because they have the ability to make choices based on morality, and not instinct. It's what separates us from all other life known life forms.

              1.3.9.3.1.3.4.1. Con:
              "Instinct" is a gross oversimplification. Animals are demonstrated to perform learned behaviour on a wealth of occasions - this is not instinctual.

              1.3.9.3.1.3.4.2. Con:
              Many domestic animals will display guilt after behaviours or incidents they know to be transgressions.

                While it is impossible for anyone to really know the thoughts of another being, human or otherwise, it is much more likely that in these instances we humans are projecting an emotional causation on to the learned behavior of animals. Behavior that is learned both through evolutionary symbiosis and a given animals' idiosyncratic experiences. Because we can empathize and have a tendency to anthropomorphize, we see the behavior as indicative of emotion.

            1.3.9.3.1.3.5. Con:
            Following that logic, animals are not superior to any other life form, they are simply a small part of a whole ecosystem. As such they have no legitimate right to kill other life forms as they please. This is inherently problematic.

            1.3.9.3.1.3.6. Con:
            The concept of "rights" is a creation of rational beings living in a society. The idea of "rights" seeks to transcend ecosystems and the "state of nature". If we are considering humans and other animals in their natural context of a state of nature in an ecosystem, then introducing rights is an inappropriate and anachronistic interjection.

            1.3.9.3.1.3.7. Pro:
            When we look at it biologically, assigning less value to animals is a form of discrimination. It's just discrimination based on more features than within-species discrimination (e.g. different anatomical structures or less intelligence instead of just the color of the skin).

            1.3.9.3.1.3.8. Pro:
            Human beings are not better than other animals.  An increasing amount of research is showing that they have feelings and they suffer just like humans. The literature comprises articles, books and academic papers: www.amazon.com [347]; inews.co.uk [348]; www.theguardian.com [349]; etc.

          1.3.9.3.1.5. Con:
          This argument is based off an internally judged moral system. None of the claims have hard fact behind them. Confidence brings verisimilitude but has no effect on actual truth. Proper justification is based on reality not personal preference.

          Such an act is justifiable from a hedonistic standpoint.

            1.3.9.3.1.6.1. Con:
            Ethical hedonism takes into account the pleasures of all parties involved, including animals which are capable of sensation and/or emotion.

              1.3.9.3.1.6.1.1. Pro:
              Ethical hedonists do not commit murder for pleasure, as this would not only end another's life (and thus, potential for pleasure) and cause pain, but would also cause fear in others of this being repeated. While killing an animal is not considered "murder", similar logic could be applied.

              1.3.9.3.1.6.1.2. Pro:
              While eating meat may not itself be absolutely wrong from a hedonistic perspective, the structures around which eating meat in the present day is based (i.e. factory farming) - and which its continued consumption encourages the perpetuation thereof - are highly unethical, as they cause massive amounts of suffering to animals, as well as suffering to the humans who must work in the meat industry to sustain it. A reduction in meat consumption would reduce the prevalence of these institutions.

              1.3.9.3.1.6.1.3. Con:
              Egoistic hedonism does not need to take into account the welfare of other parties.

          1.3.9.3.1.7. Pro:
          This has less to do with right and wrong, and more to do with justice. Is it just for humans to consume the flesh of other species when it is on longer necessary? There have been times in our history when it was necessary, but this is no longer the case, so a more relevant question would be 'should it be considered torture and murder to kill sentient beings when it is not a necessity?' If not, why? Why is it ok to kill animals who think and feel, when it is not necessary?

          1.3.9.3.1.8. Con:
          It is natural to eat whatever is convenient, even if it is not strictly necessary for survival. Bears, for example, are omnivores yet eat meat whenever the opportunity arises [350].

            1.3.9.3.1.8.1. Con:

          1.3.9.3.1.9. Pro:
          Killing animals to satisfy an unnecessary dietary preference creates disproportionate and unnecessary suffering.

            1.3.9.3.1.9.1. Con:
            If the issue is "unnecessary suffering" then the killing of the animal is not intrinsically wrong nor is eating meat. Causing "unnecessary suffering" is wrong.

            1.3.9.3.1.9.2. Con:
            Killing can take place without suffering, for example through gas [351] and in environments that do not induce stress.

              1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1. Con:
              This does not change the fact that it is about satisfying an unnecessary dietary preference and not necessary for actual survival.

                1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1. Con:
                Most of humans' behaviour is not necessary to survive, yet they do it if it enriches their daily lives.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                  Many humans like to buy luxury products like fancy watches, clothes and cars.

                    Conspicuous consumption has been explained [352] in the context of humans' nature, and with an eye on sexual selection and signaling, similar to the evolutionary utility peacock's tails.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.2. Pro:
                  Humans often enjoy partaking in alcohol, drugs, shopping and sexual intercourse for pleasure rather than out of necessity.

                    Research and science does in fact assist our survival by enabling us to deal with threats that may not be apparent to a lay individual.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.5. Con:
                  Unlike consumption of meat, the vast majority of all science, art, culture and languages comes without the infliction of suffering and harm to other living beings.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.6. Con:
                  If much of humans' behaviour is not necessary for survival, it should be judged depending on the impact of that behaviour. While much of it, such as creating and and research, do not cause harm to others, eating meat is an example where extreme harm is caused, which means the behaviour is not justified.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.7. Pro:
                  Some of the oldest forms of human expression and art are cave paintings [353] of wild game, prey of humans. The chase and consumption of meat have therefore constituted a central component of human culture since its beginning.

                    1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.7.1. Con:
                    The species [354] found most often in cave paintings were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones. The most common animal hunting and meat consumption practices in the stone-age have not, therefore, necessarily made significant contribution to this part of human cultural history.

                      1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.7.1.1. Pro:
                      It makes logical sense that cavemen would depict the animals and hunts that were most glorious, exciting, spectacular, or otherwise worthy of commemoration, rather than hunts and gatherings which would be seen as mundane and routine to them.

                1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.2. Con:
                If unnecessary is defined as "not necessary for survival" and if "not necessary for survival" is the reason given for why eating meat is wrong, then the logical extension of this view is to stop masturbating and producing art since both of these activities can be construed to be not strictly necessary for survival.

                  1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.2.1. Con:
                  Those activities are generally not harmful to other living things. Bestiality, for instance, is illegal and morally frowned upon.

              1.3.9.3.1.9.2.2. Con:
              Even without appearing to suffer, killing an animal can only be justified under extreme circumstances.

        1.3.9.3.2. Pro:
        The term "delicious" is subjective – what is tasty to one person may be disgusting to the next.

          1.3.9.3.2.1. Pro:
          A part of what we find enjoyable in food is what we are used to. If we change to vegetarian food we will become accustomed to those flavours and meat would seem less appealing.

            1.3.9.3.2.1.1. Pro:
            It would be easier to grow up on a vegetarian or vegan diet than to have to learn later to like substitutes, once acquired tastes have been acquired.

          1.3.9.3.2.2. Pro:
          Eventhough taste is individual and everyone experiences the pleasure of eating food, which he or she never tasted before, the sense that meat is 'good' and 'tasty' is a social phenomena. An example of the opposite direction but same phenomena could be algae, which are disliked by many people, without being tasted in the first place.

        1.3.9.3.3. Pro:
        Killing and harming animals for other sensual experiences is already deemed immoral. (E.g. for visual entertainment in movies, bull fighting, dog-fights etc.) There is no reason that tasting should be treated differently.

        1.3.9.3.4. Con:
        There is no data to suggest that the thought of animal suffering accompanies the taste of meat.

          1.3.9.3.4.1. Pro:
          People unaware of or uninterested in the moral implications of eating meat would not be likely - or in some cases, even able - to associate its taste with something which is not prominent - or even existent, in some cases - in their minds.

          1.3.9.3.4.2. Con:
          It is logical to surmise that someone who is consciously aware of and interested in issues of animal welfare would be repulsed by meat as a reminder of the issues.

        1.3.9.3.5. Con:
        People who are incapable of deriving pleasure from meat consumption can voluntarily stop eating meat. But there are many people who enjoy meat consumption despite this fact.

    1.3.10. Pro:
    Low retention rates among vegetarians could be an indication that the majority of people cannot consistently abstain [355] from eating meat. If this is the case, expecting humans to abstain from meat consumption contradicts [356] the categorical imperative [357] and thus cannot be unethical, or "wrong" to eat meat.

    1.3.11. Pro:
    The consumption [358] of (cooked) meat was crucial for the development of the human brain. Therefore you can state that eating meat is what made humans what they are today.

      1.3.11.1. Pro:
      According to authoritynutrition.com [359], "Humans also have canines, with big brains, opposing thumbs and the ability to make tools to hunt. Meat was one of the reasons humans were able to evolve such large, elaborate brains." It is in our nature to eat meat, seeing as we were created with the necessary attributes to efficiently hunt and eat meat.

        1.3.11.1.1. Con:
        Canines have nothing to do with us being carnivorous. Almost all mammals have them, herbivourous or not.

          1.3.11.1.1.1. Pro:
          Although humans have canines, the animal with the largest canines is a herbivore (ie. hippo)

        1.3.11.1.2. Con:
        We have the ability to make tools to hunt. The same thing that makes someone capable of making tools - a greater capacity for abstract and logical thinking - can also make them capable of getting enough sustenance without consuming meat.

      1.3.11.2. Pro:

        1.3.11.3.2. Pro:
        The brain requires 20 percent of a human’s energy when resting; by comparison, an ape’s brain requires only 8 percent. This means that from the time of H. erectus, the human body has depended on a diet of energy-dense food—especially meat.

      1.3.11.4. Con:
      Just because something was necessary or relevant in the past doesn't make it necessary or relevant in the current context [363]. While eating meat did provide the caloric intake necessary for the development and evolution of the human brain, this fact holds no bearing in the modern age, where meat consumption is not tied to survival in many instances.

        1.3.11.4.1. Con:
        There are very serious concerns about the mental [364] as well as thephysical risks of vegetarianism. [365] 
        
        Fish are particularly important for our health [366]. That is true not only for the body, but even more so for brain health. [367]

      1.3.11.5. Con:
      By the same logic we have not reached some kind of endpoint to this evolution, and in keeping with that one might consider that with those brains comes a self awareness, and with that self awareness comes the higher-order human traits such as compassion and empathy, and with these higher order traits come new aspirations and new appetites for self-actualisation. Just as clean air was desired after industrialisation, eliminating cruelty from ones diet will continue to be a big part of our future.

      1.3.11.7. Pro:
      We all know well that we simply are what we eat. So basically saying that the type of food which really helped us expand, evolve and make all that progress is bad equals to saying that a priori we shouldn't have been expanding and evolving all this time.

    1.3.12. Pro:
    Early humans were known as hunter-gatherers [369], not only gatherers. Therefore hunting animals and consuming their meat was something typical human from the very beginning.

      1.3.12.1. Con:
      The part of "hunting animals" has now been superseded by industrial food production, leaving only meat consumption as "something typical" from early human times.

      1.3.12.2. Con:
      Many humans or human populations were largely vegetarian over long stretches of time. Anthropological studies substantially challenge such beliefs and some sources even claim that "Human ancestors were nearly all vegetarians".[1] [370][2] [371][3] [372][4] [373][5] [374]

      1.3.12.3. Pro:
      Humans are superb endurance [375] runners - an important skill for chasing prey.

        1.3.12.3.1. Pro:
        Humans can even outrun horses [376].

        1.3.12.3.2. Con:
        This is also an important skill to run away from carnivores.

          1.3.12.3.2.1. Con:
          Humans' final velocity [377] is simply not high enough to run away from most of the carnivores.

      1.3.12.4. Pro:
      Human evolution, physiology and behavior are adapted to hunting and the consumption of meat. Humans have thus been called [378] a "fully evolved hunting animal".

        1.3.12.4.1. Pro:
        The evolutionary physiology of human hands has been linked [379] to the use of tools with the specific use of hunting.

        1.3.12.4.2. Pro:
        The comparatively large size of the human brain has been linked [380] to the necessities of hunting, for example in terms of social organization.

        Humans have unparalleled ability to mitigate heat.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [381]

        1.3.12.4.4. Con:
        Compared to animals of similar size humans are among the slowest runners, thus rendering them unable to catch prey.

        1.3.12.4.5. Con:
        Humans lack natural weapons (such as claws) to kill a prey animal once caught.

          1.3.12.4.5.1. Con:
          Humans are endurance hunters - weapons are less necessary to kill an already exhausted prey animal.

          1.3.12.4.5.2. Con:
          Against smaller (and exhausted) prey animals, barehanded attacks (deliberate neck-breaking, etc.) are a perfectly viable way to kill.

          1.3.12.4.5.3. Con:
          The human weapon is his use of tools. 
          Intellect derived from an enlarged brain, which itself evolved from a protein rich diet, is what allowed us to figure out how to use them.

        1.3.12.4.6. Con:
        Unlike humans, other animals do not overproduce/overhunt and throw away most of their food.

          1.3.12.4.6.1. Con:
          Some predators kill for reasons other than [382] food procurement, for example to practice their hunting skills.

          1.3.12.4.6.2. Con:
          This argument applies to human food production in general, but only to a small degree to meat. Compared to other food categories the share of the meat production lost during growth, harvesting, processing distribution and consumption is actually lower [383].

          1.3.12.4.6.3. Pro:
          Experts estimate that globally almost 12 billion animals' [384] lives are lost each year due to household food wastage. And one third [385] of the edible parts of all food produced is lost/wasted globally. This equals about 1.3 billion tons of food per year. An extraordinary amount of living creatures born to be wasted.

          1.3.12.4.6.4. Con:
          Some predators do. It is known as surplus killing [386], in which preditors kill more prey than they can immediately eat and then cache or abandon the remainder.

            1.3.12.4.6.4.1. Con:
            Scavengers [387] and weaker / older predators rely on such leftovers as feed, thus the 'left overs' will not be wasted.

      1.3.12.5. Con:
      Vegetarianism is a greater part of our genetic heritage than meat-eating. Rationale: Apes spent more time evolving during the Miocene than the early humans (which is a sub-group of the apes) did later during the Pleistocene.  All other apes are almost vegetarians.(livescience.com [388],newscientist.com [389])

      1.3.12.6. Con:
      It's easier to gather a plant than to hunt an animal. Therefore our ancestors were more gatherers than hunters.

        1.3.12.6.1. Con:
        It might be easier to gather a plant, but it is not easier to plant than to hunt. Taking into consideration that this involves a nuanced understanding of farming, having to plant, water, cultivate and wait, planting and eating only plants is not an option if you are starving. Hunting could potentially take minutes/hours, whereas farming involves constant attention over months.

        1.3.12.6.2. Con:
        From experience in the bush, it is easier and more efficient to get your daily needs for nutrition by hunting and eating animals than it is by gathering plants. Therefore I would argue that our ancestors met their caloric needs primarily through animal consumption.

      1.3.12.7. Pro:
      The structure of the human body, such as upright posture and density of sweat gland distribution, suggest an evolutionary advantage towards persistence hunting due to unparalleled heat mitigation. Waterlogged by Dr. Tim Noakes [390]

      1.3.12.8. Pro:
      Human dentition is designed to mechanically process both meat and vegetables. Millions of years of evolution have shaped us with canine teeth to be able to pierce meat. We have genetic code for enzymes that process meat in our DNA and have been omnivorous since the earliest human relatives. The problem is not the humans should stop eating meat, the problem is the process for how the meat makes it to our plates.

        1.3.12.8.1. Pro:
        Biologically speaking, the human dentition provides information on the proportions of different types of food we should be ingesting, and 1/8 of it should be meat (4 canines out of 32 teeth).

          1.3.12.8.1.1. Con:
          Exact numbers of teeth are not relevant, as evolution does not "plan ahead" in this manner or deliberately create specific ratios, rather creates or further emphasizes traits which prove useful. Humans would develop exactly as many canines (and molars) as they needed at the time, so the exact numbers or ratios do not prove what is described here, as it is possible that having more molars is more beneficial in ways that having more canines is not. (Also, molars are still used to chew meat.)

      1.3.12.9. Pro:
      Eating meat has created social structure from group hunting which helped with intelligence and creating societies. We are who we are because we eat meat.

        1.3.12.9.1. Con:
        Who we become is based on our decisions from today. Historical practices have been successfully abandoned without unduly negatively affecting society.

      1.3.12.10. Pro:
      Human beings have long been understood to be omnivores. Perhaps the arguments "eating less meat is better" or "substituting land-mammal meat with farmed fish is better" would be more persuasive.

      1.3.12.11. Pro:
      As a species we are good hunters, not only as a result of our superb reasoning skills, but because of possession of many biological adaptations which are specific to carnivorous animals.

        1.3.12.11.1. Pro:
        Humans are for example able to outrun every animal in long enough distance [391], which is likely to have been an advantage over other predators when hunting.

          1.3.12.11.1.1. Con:
          There are other plausible explanations for how that specific adaptation could have been acquired or emerged - it could equally be used to aid escape from predators, or cover more ground while searching for food, or - as the article also alludes to - beating other scavengers to a meal.

      1.3.12.12. Con:
      Whilst we may have been hunter-gatherers in the past it does not mean we should continue to be. Continuing to be hunter-gatherers on the basis that we were known as hunter-gatherers is an Appeal to Tradition [392]

        1.3.12.12.1. Con:
        A specific mode of nutrition is no tradition; otherwise, all living beings have traditions. Rather, it is a naturally (evolutionary) developed way of behavior. Therefore, this is no appeal to tradition but an appeal to our nature.

      1.3.12.13. Con:
      Humans have not evolved to hunt, eat, or digest meat very successfully.

        1.3.12.13.1. Con:
        That humans' anatomy enables them to stand upright allows for other hunting methods that do not require typical predator anatomy.

        1.3.12.13.3. Pro:
        What is natural can be derived. Organisms' anatomy and physiology are good indicators for the kind of lifestyle they have adapted to - even though this does not preclude the possibility that an "un-natural" lifestyle is established.

          1.3.12.13.3.1. Pro:
          Anatomy and physiology are the outcomes of evolutionary processes. These are determined by the environment in which certain traits flourish while others perish. The anatomy and physiology of humans is thus an indicator for the natural environment in which they developed.

        1.3.12.13.4. Pro:
        Studying evolution, science and data gives a different perspective. We don't have the sharp teeth, claws or short intestinal track of carnivores. Also, our closest animal relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos which have an almost exclusively plant based diet (less than 2% insects and animals).

          1.3.12.13.4.1. Con:
          When available (but usually at least 3% of total consumption) chimps prefer to eat meat due to the nutritional advantages. This quantity is significant when comparing the encephalization of humans, species ancestral to humans, and modern apes to their amount of consumption of proteins. For instance, humans require only as little as 15-20% of their total consumption to be protein to maintain muscle mass and brain function.completehumanperformance.com [393] www-bcf.usc.edu [394]

          The evolutionary growth of the human brain could only have been supported by meat consumption.Waterlogged by Dr. Tim Noakes [395]

          1.3.12.13.4.3. Con:
          Evolved with primates then took a sharp turn towards meat consumption with the shortening of our gut and efficient fat digestion, the loss of our ability to easily produce retinol from carotenoids, B12 from plants.

        1.3.12.13.5. Pro:
        Of all the anthropoid apes, man's teeth and digestive system most closely resembles the chimpanzees, gibbons, gorillas and orangutans. In captivity some of these animals will eat meat if starved, but in the wild all eat a vegetarian diet. [396]

          1.3.12.13.5.1. Pro:
          Humans actually have the jaw structure of frugivores, not carnivores, and our digestive system is not built to digest meat as easy as other animals

          1.3.12.13.5.2. Con:
          Meat eating and hunting among chimpanzees is normal. [397] Meat is also used in gaining political ground in the troop and as presents when attempting to mate.

        1.3.12.13.6. Pro:
        Humans' canines are not specially meant for processing meat. All carnivores in comparison - dogs, cats, lions etc. - have carnassial teeth [398] at the back of their mouths, "blade-like and sharp and perfect for slicing meat".

          1.3.12.13.6.1. Con:
          The presence of certain teeth does not necessarily correlate with natural dietary preferences. Hippos [399], gorillas [400] and camels [401] have canine teeth, yet are herbivores.

            1.3.12.13.6.1.1. Con:
            Gorillas [402] have those large canines mainly for self defense and deterrence reasons. Furthermore they chew a lot of heavy twigs and bark, which requires strong teeth.

              1.3.12.13.6.1.1.1. Con:
              This only supports the argument that there is no reliable connection between the presence of canines and eating meat. There are plenty of other reasons for their presence.

          1.3.12.13.6.2. Con:
          Humans' natural physiology made them [403] a tool-using species. We do not need canine teeth/claws to slice meat because we have tools for doing so.

          1.3.12.13.6.3. Con:
          We evolved with primates, then switched to eating meat later in the evolutionary path. We dont kill or hunt with our teeth. We can easily eat and digest meat and many of us do.

          1.3.12.13.6.4. Pro:
          Humans do not have the large mouth or long, pointed teeth of carnivores. Human teeth [404] are short and flat for chewing fibrous food.

        1.3.12.13.7. Pro:
        Meat-eating animals have no skin pores and perspire [405] through the tongue, whereas herbivores perspire through skin pores. Humans perspire through their skin pores.

          1.3.12.13.7.1. Con:
          The mode of perspiration might correlate with the diet of many animals - but this does not imply a causal determination. Bears, for example, do not have skin pores, yet they can live on a plant-based diet, as pandas do.

          1.3.12.13.7.2. Con:
          Great white sharks, an apex predator, do not perspire through the tongue. The above claim is unfounded.

        1.3.12.13.8. Pro:
        Meat-eating animals have an intestinal tract [406] that is only 3 times their body length, so that rapidly decaying meat can pass through quickly, whereas herbivores have an intestinal tract 10-12 times their body length. Humans have an intestinal tract 10-12 times their body length, to allow slower digestion [407] of plants.

        1.3.12.13.9. Pro:
        Meat-eating animals, including humans, have more acidic stomachs [408] to digest meat than herbivores.

        1.3.12.13.10. Pro:
        Whereas carnivores have acid saliva with no enzyme ptyalin [409] (needed to pre-digest grains), herbivores have alkaline saliva with ptyalin. Humans have alkaline saliva with ptyalin to pre-digest grains.

          1.3.12.13.10.1. Con:
          This merely proves that humans may be omnivores [410], able to digest grains and fruits as well.

            1.3.12.13.10.1.1. Pro:
            Hominidae, including humans [411], are omnivores [412].

            1.3.12.13.10.1.2. Pro:
            Omnivores are defined as generalized feeders [413], with neither carnivore nor herbivore specializations for acquiring / processing food, and who are capable of consuming and do consume both animal protein and vegetation.

              1.3.12.13.10.1.2.1. Pro:
              They basically have more generalized anatomical and physiological traits. So do humans.

        1.3.12.13.11. Pro:
        Humans, like herbivores, lack the sharp claws [414] of a carnivorous predator, used to hunt down and kill prey.

          1.3.12.13.11.1. Con:
          Claws are not essential for eating meat.

            1.3.12.13.11.1.1. Pro:
            Claws are mostly required to catch a running animal and kill it for food. This is not a process humans have to go through to eat meat.

            1.3.12.13.11.1.2. Con:
            Carnivores use their claws not only for capturing but also for disarticulating [415] their prey.

            1.3.12.13.11.1.3. Pro:
            Crocodiles do not make use of their claws for eating their prey.

              1.3.12.13.11.1.3.1. Con:
              Corcodiles are reptiles [416] and not mammals [417]. It is not valid to compare humans, being part of the mammal group, to non-mammal predators.

                1.3.12.13.11.1.3.1.1. Pro:
                There are too many features that distinguish [418] mammals form reptiles such as the possession of a neocortex, hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands.

            1.3.12.13.11.1.4. Pro:
            Pigs are omnivores and eat meat without claws.

            1.3.12.13.11.1.5. Pro:
            Meat can be prepared for humans to eat, such that it can be eaten without claws.

          1.3.12.13.11.2. Con:
          Human hands are better able to hold meat than claws. So human anatomy is superior for eating meat.

            1.3.12.13.11.2.1. Con:
            This only proves that human anatomy might be superior for holding meat. It does however not pove that humans are meant to eat/digest it.

          1.3.12.13.11.3. Con:
          Humans developed anatomical features that enable them to build and utilize tools.

            1.3.12.13.11.3.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.12.4.1.

            1.3.12.13.11.3.2. Pro:
            -> See 1.3.12.4.2.

          1.3.12.13.11.4. Con:
          -> See 1.3.12.13.6.2.

          1.3.12.13.11.5. Con:
          You do not need claws to eat meat. For instance frogs, salamanders, toads and newts do not have claws but all of them are carnivores. Humans have hands so have never needed claws while other predators like cats lack this trait so they have claws instead.

        1.3.12.13.12. Con:
        While correct, this observation does not imply a prescription. Humans do not restrict themselves to activities that their bodies are optimized to do, but rather perform a whole range of activities, that the human body is not naturally meant for.

          1.3.12.13.12.1. Con:
          Many activities that go against what our body is made for are however seen as problematic and unhealthy, for example extended sitting and diving without caution.

          1.3.12.13.12.2. Pro:
          Sitting for hours - as many office workers do - is unnatural for the human body [419] and has negative effects on overall health as well as a direct link to mortality.

            1.3.12.13.12.2.1. Con:
            This just proves that we should not be sitting for hours.

          1.3.12.13.12.3. Pro:
          Human biology points towards the benefits of polygamy - yet we are commonly expected to behave monogamously, which is not necessarily natural [420] for us.

            1.3.12.13.12.3.1. Pro:
            Concerning to the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, only 15% of its 1231 listed cultures [421] live monogamously, therefore monogamy is a rather Western (Christian) form of relationship and the majority of cultures lived polygamously.

            1.3.12.13.12.3.2. Con:
            While polygamy as a legal form of marriage may not be permitted in many countries, it is however unproblematic to live polygamous.

            1.3.12.13.12.3.3. Con:
            Polygamy is widely accepted [422] among different societies worldwide.

            1.3.12.13.12.3.4. Pro:
            Polygamy is commonly seen as [423] harmful to the Western ideal of marriage and has historically been "treated in the West as an offensive against society itself", including stigmatization.

          1.3.12.13.12.4. Pro:
          It is unnatural for human bodies to vastly go beyond the spaces and speeds they can naturally reach, for example with the help of airplanes and spacecrafts [424].

            1.3.12.13.12.4.1. Con:
            In the given examples, human bodies are largely shielded from the spaces and speeds in question. Passengers of airplanes, for example, feel neither the speed, difference in air pressure nor the cold temperatures that come with this mode of transportation.

            1.3.12.13.12.4.2. Con:
            There are limits to airplanes and spacecrafts as to how much the body can naturally endure. Thus there are restrictions set by humans' naturalness.

              1.3.12.13.12.4.2.1. Con:
              These limits can be exceeded by improving airplanes and spacecraft to travel faster while placing less strain on the body.

            1.3.12.13.12.4.3. Pro:
            Lacking wings, humans are not meant to be flying.

          1.3.12.13.12.5. Pro:
          Humans are not supposed to exist under water, yet diving is a popular and widespread hobby and sport.

            1.3.12.13.12.5.1. Con:
            The mammalian diving reflex [425] is a reflex in mammals which optimizes respiration to allow staying underwater for extended periods of time. It exists - in weaker versions - in humans, in particular babies up to 6 months old (Infant swimming [426]).

            1.3.12.13.12.5.2. Pro:
            Deep diving is only possible with special equipment such as breathing gas [427] and swimfins [428].

              1.3.12.13.12.5.2.1. Pro:
              The human lung is not able [429] to extract oxygen from water.

            1.3.12.13.12.5.3. Pro:
            In contrast to animals with bodies made for diving, humans have no skin between their fingers and toes (and thus rely on fins) and easily suffer from decompression sickness [430].

            1.3.12.13.12.5.4. Pro:
            Human skin is not made for long term stays under water. It deforms and wrinkles dramatically [431] and finally breaks down.

            1.3.12.13.12.5.5. Pro:
            Divers need to wear diving suits [432] for protection from the cold as well as high water pressure.

        1.3.12.13.13. Con:
        Humans are physically created to build and use advanced tools - and they need them [433]. Hence it is only natural for us to overcome our bodies' limitations by using tools such as knives and forks.

        1.3.12.13.14. Con:
        Humans aren't very successful at eating vegetables either (as compare to, say, a cow). These are the pains of being omnivores, and mean that humans cannot concentrate on only one kind of food. Thus, meat is an essential part of our diet. See www.livescience.com [434].

        1.3.12.13.15. Con:
        Human's digestive system is designed to eat meat therefore eating meat is fundamental to good health. For more information here is a detailed study by Dr Weston A Price on nutrition [435]

        1.3.12.13.16. Con:
        Adaptation to new circumstances and opportunities is a hallmark of evolution, and thus nature in action. A changing diet that overcomes the physical adaptation to a previous diet is thus natural.

          1.3.12.13.16.1. Pro:
          As the environment of humans has changed over time, they have adapted their diets [436] to fit with their surroundings and depending on what was available.

          1.3.12.13.16.2. Pro:
          Up until several thousand years ago, nearly all adult humans were lactose-intolerant [437]; however, when European farmers began to discover the nutritional benefits of dairy products from animal milk, increasing numbers of mutations in the gene that produces the lactase enzyme occurred, enabling many humans to adapt to a diet that included dairy.

          1.3.12.13.16.3. Pro:
          When Italian wall lizards were introduced to a new environment in the 1970s, they changed their diet [438] from one heavy in plants to one heavy in insects, and accordingly adapted their morphology over generations.

        1.3.12.13.17. Pro:
        The liver of a carnivore can detoxify [439] the excess vitamin A absorbed from a meat-based diet. The human liver cannot detoxify excess vitamin A.

  1.4. Pro:
  Vegetarian diets directly and indirectly contribute to better health outcomes for all humans.

    1.4.1. Con:
    Many populations across the globe lack the practical availability of alternative nutritional sources such as many of the East African [440] countries.

    1.4.2. Con:
    Meat contains some nutrients [441] such as vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids which are absent in a plant based diet.

    1.4.3. Pro:
    -> See 1.2.15.3.1.1.

    1.4.4. Con:
    Statistically [442] those who abstain from a meat based diet are exposed to higher health risk hazards.

      1.4.4.1. Con:
      The study cited has methodological flaws and therefore its results are uncertain, i.e. the number of participants (330) is too small to be representative and the measure of life quality is insufficient.

        1.4.4.1.1. Pro:
        The study had very bad reviews [443] on health platforms.

          1.4.4.1.1.1. Con:
          This "health" platform recommends quackery like a diet with much fruits and vegetables, when the only benefit to those is the fibre which can be gotten from insects and shellfish whereas their antioxidants [444] do not improve health but may worsen it, and low saturated fat, when women who eat less saturated fat die earlier.

        1.4.4.1.2. Pro:
        There are other more thorough studies [445] that conclude the opposite.

      1.4.4.2. Con:
      The study was comprised of self-reported data with very little explanation about what constituted each dietary subset. It's hard to draw any significant conclusions from self-reported data.

      1.4.4.3. Pro:
      Vegetarianism is linked to reduced physical and mental health, increased risk of allergies and specific forms of cancer. Vegetarians, who are on average more health conscious than the general population, are twice as often sick, and spend twice as much money on doctors, when compared to equally health conscious meat eaters. journals.plos.org [446]

      1.4.4.4. Con:
      This relies on cherry-picked data, when there is much more data and research which concludes otherwise. A meta-analysis [447] is a better way to get a larger spectrum of properly representative data.

      1.4.4.5. Pro:
      Ketosis is a state of metabolism that cannot be achieved without consuming meat.

    1.4.5. Con:
    Not all vegetarians have a healthy diet. There is a lot of meatless junk food available. Hence, an absence of meat in a diet does not equal a healthier diet.

      1.4.5.1. Pro:
      Common vegetarian food can easily contain more saturated fat than meat products:many cheeses [448] contain double (or more) the amount of saturated fat that steak contains per 100g.

      1.4.5.2. Con:
      Obviously there is plenty of room for variation in the health outcomes of both vegetarian and omnivorous diets. However, on average, vegetarian diets are more healthy.

      1.4.5.3. Pro:
      A good reason for why meats are unhealthy is the artificial means meat is raised, the hormones, etc.  Similarly, pesticides on vegetables are unhealthy too. Comparing vegetables to meats obfuscates the real causes of health detriments.

      1.4.5.4. Pro:
      A heathy vegan diet is theoretically possible, but it is extremely hard to maintain such a diet long term without consuming any animal products, unless you take an industrial preconceived super balanced food.

        1.4.5.4.1. Con:
        With an increase in vegetarians and vegans, there would be more allowances made and techniques developed to assist in maintaining these diets, making it easier and healthier to maintain them.

        1.4.5.4.2. Pro:
        Certain professions (i.e. wildland firefighting) require high body mass and muscular strength which can be logistically difficult, biologically disruptive, and expensive for some individuals to maintain on a vegetarian/vegan diet.

        1.4.5.4.3. Pro:
        Sports and high-performance diets count on high intakes of meat to build muscle and make elite performances possible. Vegetarian supplements such as soy can have some negative health effects [449].

        1.4.5.4.4. Pro:
        An omnivorous diet consisting of mostly vegetables supplemented by a small to moderate amount of meat is not much different to a full vegetarian or vegan diet, yet is more balanced and convenient because you are not going out of your way to avoid something completely.

      1.4.5.5. Con:
      That is not an argument for eating meat, but for eating more healthy food, which is clearly possible, and will become more easy as the range of vegetarian food available increases

    1.4.6. Pro:
    Scientists have concluded that vegetarian diets can in fact provide benefits [450] in the treatment and prevention of certain diseases.

      1.4.6.1. Pro:
      A review of studies [451] found that plant-based diets reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

      1.4.6.2. Pro:
      Eating plant foods instead of animal-based foods [452] can bring about health benefits including reducing the chances of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and some types of cancer.

        1.4.6.2.1. Con:
        The niacin in animal protein decreases VLDL and LDL, the mostly-fat bad cholesterol that clog arteries, and increases HDL, the mostly-protein good cholesterol that removes arterial plaque.

      1.4.6.3. Pro:
      The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [453] has stated that well planned vegetarian diets are nutritionally adequate and appropriate for individuals at all stages of life.

        1.4.6.3.1. Con:
        Well planned diets are good for people who have time, and money for them, but many people just don't have that amount of time to invest, or the funds to accommodate them, so for them, a simple diet involving meat is a necessity.

          1.4.6.3.1.1. Con:
          Improved education may allow people to more easily compose adequate vegetarian diets.

        1.4.6.3.2. Con:
        Well planned diets are not always effective. Vegetarian sources of protein are not always effectively processed, leaving some people malnourished. Even when the meal contains adequate supplies of protein it won't always be absorbed.

        1.4.6.3.3. Pro:
        According to the American Dietetic Association [454] a vegetarian diet can meet protein requirements, provide all the essential amino-acids, necessary vitamins, fats and minerals.

          1.4.6.3.3.1. Con:
          Vegetables may contain toxins and antinutrients [455] which interfere with the absorption of nutrients.

            1.4.6.3.3.1.1. Con:
            These toxins can easily be deactivated by adequate cooking.

              1.4.6.3.3.1.1.1. Con:
              Aflatoxin, cyanogenic glycosides, glycoalkaloids, hypoglycin, acetogenins, glucose-6 phosphate, allergens, acrylamide, PAHs, acetaldehyde, and nitrosamine are not deactivated by cooking.

      1.4.6.4. Pro:
      A major study by Oxford University [456] concluded that universal adoption of vegetarian diets could avoid 7.3 million deaths per year by 2050.

        1.4.6.4.1. Con:
        This study confounds three or four causes and conflates them with a more plant-based diet when their effects are not correlated with a more plant-based diet.

        1.4.6.4.2. Con:
        The studies that claim animal over plant diets use more resources such as fuel, irrigation, land, and fertilizer discount the fuel spent to transport crops from the climates suited to them like volcanic, tropical, and marine environments (e.g. 9000 miles for coconuts between Oceania and America) and the greater land and fertilizer use for human crops on soils that don't natively support staples.

        1.4.6.4.3. Con:
        India has a wide adoption of vegetarianism but its lifespan lags France, whose diet is rich in saturated fat and livestock, by 20 years.  The leading cause of death in India is heart disease.

      1.4.6.5. Con:
      There is much we do not yet understand about gut health and how the body metabolises and interacts with foods.

      1.4.6.6. Pro:
      The idea of a meatless diet being weak or deficient in protein is not accurate as we know some of the strongest animals on Earth are vegetarian.

        1.4.6.6.1. Con:
        The human metabolism is much different [457] from that of elephants, gorillas, and cattle. These animals spend a majority of their time eating and their stomachs are designed to process hard to digest plant matter. Humans are not designed to eat purely plants in the same way and therefore cannot subsist on the same diet and expect the same results.

          1.4.6.6.1.1. Con:
          This argument doesn't say anything about strength or protein, only metabolism - so con.

        1.4.6.6.2. Pro:
        As the human metabolism is mainly designed to digest nuts and fruits, humans do not have any problem living on a vegetarian diet.

          1.4.6.6.2.1. Con:
          There are several essential amino acids that are near impossible for a vegetarian to include in their diet daily. These amino acids are necessary for optimal functioning and protein synthesis. Animal proteins are closer to our protein source, providing a complete array of amino acids needed in our body

        1.4.6.6.3. Con:
        Fishes eat plankton, some mammals eat only meat , some only vegetables. Comparing humans to other species that are not similar in their metabolism and dietary need is a fallacy at best and illogical in nature.

          1.4.6.6.3.1. Con:
          There is no fallacy in that argument the original claim never said anything about humans - aside from the previously edited argument.

        1.4.6.6.4. Con:
        There are many nutrients "vegans" don't get: retinol, carnitine, saturated fat, cobalamin, cholecalciferol, copper and zinc, menaquinone-4, sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and carnosine.

          1.4.6.6.4.1. Con:
          This claim offers nothing about strength or protein and being on  plant based diet - so con.

      1.4.6.7. Con:
      Individual studies might show advantages to a vegetarian diet, but literature reviews [458] show no significant gains when all the various popular diets are compared to each other. Many different diets based primarily on the idea that we should eat whole food and mostly plants all show substantial health gains. We don't need to remove meat to achieve the health outcomes -- we just need to make sure we get enough plants and focus on unprocessed foods.

      1.4.6.8. Pro:
      Eating meat is no longer necessary due to the range of meat substitutes on offer.

        1.4.6.8.1. Con:
        The flesh substitutes are crumbly instead of stringy and are made from beans whose estrogens are bad for males, from monoculture sources of saturated fat like coconuts, and from starch fillers.

      1.4.6.9. Con:
      In the long run (many years into the diet), vegetarianism makes people depressed, as stated by Lierre Keith in her book The Vegetarian Myth.

      1.4.6.10. Con:
      This health claim was promoted by vegetarian societies that deceptively qualified their dietary recommendation with "well-planned" when this doesn't belong to any single food group.

        1.4.6.10.1. Pro:
        It's much easier to ruin your health on a vegetarian diet than omnivorose diet.

      1.4.6.11. Con:
      The alleged health benefits of vegetarianism came from caloric restriction and fibre, both of which can be gotten from omnivory and carnivory, whereas alcohol and tobacco are both plant products that were arbitrarily excluded in the vegetarian diet.

      1.4.6.12. Con:
      Freefromharm.org contradicts itself where it says our species needs the same nutrients but then some of us are allergic or diseased [but doesn't say so by genetics].  Thus some lack the ability to digest lactose in milk, gluten in wheat, beta-carotene in several crops, albumen in egg white, glucose-6-phosphate in fava, and lectins in seeds and nightshades.

      1.4.6.13. Con:
      The phytate [459] antinutrient in whole grains has killed 100,000s by pellagra [460] and ric [461]k [462]ets [463].  Tannin antinutrients destroy thiamine in the bran that has the same phytate which without the bran causes beriberi.

      1.4.6.14. Con:
      A vegetarian diet requires a complete set of disparate ingredients that, when taken in bad proportion or alone, cause heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cavities, osteoporosis, kidney stones, fatigue, brain fog, and malnutrition.  The nutritional supplements with the diet suffer from different bioavailabilities such that amine and vitamin compounds cause overdose of calcium and transition metals whereas carbonate and citrate compounds are not absorbed well.

      1.4.6.15. Con:
      The same species does require very different nutrients.  Freefromharm.org will quote-mine nutritionists, rather than doctors or scientists, for requirements when it serves their position even if it supports opposite premises: milk is only for babies which is why adults lose the ability to digest milk (same species) but everyone needs the same nutrients.  Diet varies by age (enzymes and fatty acids for extremes), sex (saturated fat, calcium, iron for women), and culture (tastes and enzymes).

    1.4.7. Con:
    People who must already follow restrictive diets [464] due to medical conditions such as IBS or IBD cannot consume most plant-based or dairy sources of protein, making it necessary for them to resort to meat-based proteins.

      1.4.7.1. Con:
      The source cited lists the following high-protein foods under "good to eat food": lentils, Quorn (high-protein meat substitute), a variety of different nuts, 5 types of protein powder, brown rice, bean sprouts, and more. Even spinach [465] is 30% protein/calorie, compared to 33% in a hamburger patty [466].

        1.4.7.1.1. Con:
        Unfortunately plant diets are high in undigestable's like insoluble fibre, and certain sugars. The fodmaps and other diets map numerous forms of plant foods that even doctors recommend people with digestive problems experiment with removing, because of these. The foods mentioned above; mushrooms, lentils, rice, bean sprouts etc, are all mentioned in these types of diets as potential food allergens/carbs. It's the carbohydrates like fructose & allergens like gluten that are problematic.

      1.4.7.2. Pro:
      Considering the extreme genetic diversity of human kind and the astronomical complexity of protein stings, blocks and complexes, it would be disastrous for certain individuals to stop eating meat, as not all people can metabolize certain protein blocks, gluten for instance.

      1.4.7.3. Pro:
      Some people biologically require animal protein and will fall ill from malnutrition and depression when they switch to vegetarian diets. Having to go back to meat-inclusive meals is the only way to recover their health.

        1.4.7.3.1. Pro:
        After millenia of human being's bodies becoming accustomed to eating meat, it seems reckless to suggest that it could be healthy for everyone to all of a sudden stop eating meat.

          1.4.7.3.1.1. Con:
          -> See 1.4.6.3.

        1.4.7.3.2. Con:
        There is no scientific evidence to back up this statement.

      1.4.7.4. Pro:
      For people who have problems with their digestive tract, there can be disastrous health consequences when eating the nuts, grains and fibrous vegetation needed in a vegetarian diet. I know this as I have Crohn's disease. Here are some other links: insoluble fibre [467] and foods that tax your system [468]. Here is some specific info on diet if you have a gut troubles [469].

        1.4.7.4.1. Con:
        According to those sources cited, vegetables are positive for digestion when prepared correctly, i.e. cooked, fermented, or soaked. Raw vegetables are easily avoided regardless of the meat status of the diet.

    1.4.8. Pro:
    Eating meat is linked to increased risks for certain types of cancer.

      1.4.8.1. Pro:
      USDA researchers [470] have found that eating two ounces of chicken per day (the equivalent of a third to a half of a boneless breast) exposes a consumer to 3 - 5 micrograms of the most carcinogenic form of arsenic, which can dramatically increase cancer risk.

        1.4.8.1.1. Con:
        There is no direct reference to the study here. Severe confounding or methodological challenges is possible.

      1.4.8.2. Pro:
      Eating meat, particularly processed meats and bacon, has been recognized by the World Health Organization to be carcinogenic [471].

        1.4.8.2.1. Con:
        The carcinogens in processed meats come from heat and vegetal and mineral nitrites, not flesh.  The same carcinogens are present in potato chips, heated oils, prunes, and carrots.

      1.4.8.3. Con:
      Recent research implies that cancer is a metabolic decrease, which in part forms the basis of the ketogenic diet (eating meat and good fat). Cancer is a metabolic disease [472]

      1.4.8.4. Pro:
      Those who eat meat are far more likely to contract cancer than those following a vegetarian [473] diet.

      1.4.8.5. Con:
      Studies done on negative health consequences of meat consumption are done in high carbohydrate diets. Carbohydrates are closer linked with cancer than meat consumption. 
      Starving cancer: Dominic D'Agostino at TEDxTampaBay [474]

      1.4.8.6. Pro:
      Studies have linked heme iron found in red meat with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer [475]. Vegetarian sources of iron like leafy greens and beans contain non-heme iron [476].

        1.4.8.6.1. Pro:
        The finding that red meat increases the risk of colon cancer was confirmed in an observatory study [477] of US citizens in which red meat featured as prominent factor.

        1.4.8.6.2. Con:
        Studies on the effects of red meat intake do not account for the differences in processed and un-processed meat, which is unacceptable because the two have vastly different effects.

        1.4.8.6.3. Con:
        A meta-analysis [478] of red meat-cancer studies found that the link is, at best, weak.

          1.4.8.6.3.1. Pro:
          Further meta-analysis found that the red meat-cancer connection holds only slightly for men [479] and not for females.

        1.4.8.6.4. Pro:
        When meat is cooked excessively, carcinogens [480] can be produced that are linked to cancer.

          1.4.8.6.4.1. Con:
          This can be avoided by cooking meat carefully and in accordance with safety guidelines.

            1.4.8.6.4.1.1. Con:
            Nobody will ever cook meat perfectly every time, and oftentimes (e.g. in restaurants) lay people will trust professional cooks, who may have an improper, incomplete, or out of date education/training.

    1.4.9. Pro:
    The farming of meat can fuel the spread of disease and ingestion of drugs that may pose significant risks to human health.

      1.4.9.1. Pro:
      Antibiotic use in animals farmed for meat can have harmful effects for human health.

        1.4.9.1.1. Pro:
        Studies [481] suggest that antibiotic resistance in humans may be encouraged by the widespread use of nontherapeutic antibiotics in animals.

        1.4.9.1.2. Pro:
        75% of the antibiotics used on livestock are not absorbed by the animals and are instead excreted in their faeces, posing a serious risk [482] to public health.

      1.4.9.2. Pro:
      Diseases [483] such as BSE, MRSA or bird flu [484] are connected to intensive livestock farming conditions.

        1.4.9.2.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.1.

        1.4.9.2.2. Pro:
        Dirty, crowded conditions on factory farms can propagate sickness and disease among the animals. These diseases also lead to human infections.

          1.4.9.2.2.1. Con:
          In Europe the regulation of factory farming, called the Five Freedoms [485], prevents sickness and stops diseases from spreading.

      1.4.9.3. Con:
      -> See 1.1.1.12.2.7.1.

      1.4.9.4. Pro:
      Meat from factory farming contains a number of growth hormones [486] that are detrimental to our health.

        1.4.9.4.1. Con:
        Chicken [487] meat contains no growth hormones.

      1.4.9.5. Con:
      This is only true of CAFO or Industrial meat production.  Organic silvopasture, permacultural, and organic intensive grazing meat production do not create the same health risks. They do not use antibiotics and animal waste doesn't build up. It is, instead, immediately turned into fertilizer. Animals are kept away from areas of the pasture long enough for the waste to be incorporated into the soil and for the plants to recover.

      1.4.9.6. Pro:
      Animals cause vegetarian foods to get contaminated, which leads to food-borne illness. Eating meat increases the capabilities of animal products (such as manure) to contaminate crops (such as using manure for fertilizer or wastewater for irrigation). [488]This could lead to people who do not eat meat (such as vegetarians) to be affected (i.e. sick) by it, even though they do not contribute to the problem.

    1.4.10. Con:
    When looking at smaller sample sizes and more diverse diets there is little to suggest that meat is inherently unhealthy.

      1.4.10.1. Pro:
      The Inuit people in Russia, US, Canada, and Greenland survive primarily off of meat while suffering fewer health problems [489] than modern nations; even with their high animal fat and protein diet.

        1.4.10.1.1. Pro:
        The Innuit people consume a diet suited to the natural adaptations made over generations to their digestive tracts. Diets of the Western and developed world can potentially be less healthy as they introduce access to a variety of foodstuffs to which individuals' digestive tracts are unlikely to be accustomed.

        1.4.10.1.2. Con:
        Comparing the lifestyle and diet of the Inuit people to that of most meat consumers is a false equivalency. The source of their meat is vastly different from industrially produced meat found in grocery stores, and their daily lives are vastly different from the average meat consumer. Even when adjusted by age, race, smoking, exercise, personal income, educational level, marital status, alcohol, and region, studies [490] have shown that plant based diets lead to reduced health risks.

      1.4.10.2. Con:
      The lifestyles of these groups are radically different from normal human populations in very many ways. The fact that they are healthy therefore does not prove that their consumption of meat does not harm them - it could simply be the case that the harm is offset by other aspects of their lifestyles.

        1.4.10.2.1. Con:
        There is no baseline for 'normal human populations' . Every established ethnic and regional group has adapted their diet to their environment and available resources. Changes to these diets result in negative health effects and so whilst eating meat does not confer any advantage, ceasing its consumption will inflict a negative effect on their health.

        1.4.10.2.2. Pro:
        For the group tests to be valid, they should also be checked for malnutrition in general, and also be tested with vegan equivalent supplements that offer a similar dose of iron, protein and other nutrients that those groups' existing diets are lacking.

      1.4.10.3. Pro:
      The Masasai tribe in the Kalahari desert are healthy yet primarily eat meat and Mongongo nuts [491].

      1.4.10.4. Con:
      By definition, the sample sizes are smaller, and therefore less predictive of dynamics governing the overall population.

        1.4.10.4.1. Con:
        There is no need to predict the characteristics of the whole population. As long as identifiable groups can be shown to benefit from meat consumption, that is sufficient to prove that not everyone should stop eating meat.

      1.4.10.5. Pro:
      A study of 544 seven-year-old children in Kenya who previously had a vegan diet found that: 
      "The group that received the meat supplement showed the biggest improvement in fluid intelligence over the two years, and those who had either milk or energy supplements were better than the controls. The group that received the meat supplements were more active in the playground, more talkative and playful, and showed more leadership skills," (Link [492])

      1.4.10.6. Pro:
      The science of diet is far from settled. This is a complex topic that will take many decades, if not centuries to understand. The advent of quantum super computer arrays will undoubtedly speed our understanding of diet, but today, there is much to learn about nutrition and heath. To suggest otherwise is to be dishonest about the topic. Take the science of salt consumption as a recent example. Today, it is now known that the dangers of too little salt vastly out weigh the dangers of too much.

      1.4.10.7. Pro:
      -> See 1.4.4.3.

      1.4.10.8. Pro:
      Humans are accustomed to eating meals containing meat. The meals not only gives us proteins that are important for several bodily functions but also even the people who are eating vegetables don't necessarily become healthier. You become healthier based on you intake of foods that your body needs, which may include meat. I think that genes, outside factors (smoking, levels of stress, sleep time, junk food etc.), have a actually bigger toll on the body than the actual consumption of meat.

        1.4.10.8.1. Con:
        This appeals to tradition. None of the nutrients listed are exclusive to meat. The rest of your argument is based on conjecture. Studies [493] have shown the reduced risk of diseases from plant based diets, even when adjusted by age (i.e., attained age as time variable), race, smoking, exercise, personal income, educational level, marital status, alcohol, and region.

    1.4.11. Pro:
    Living without meat reduces metabolic risk [494] factors and thus reduces the likelihood of strokes, diabetes, and heart conditions.

      1.4.11.1. Pro:
      A meatless diet helps prevent hypertension, and thus reduces the risk of stroke [495].

      1.4.11.2. Pro:
      A peer-reviewed 2004 study [496] from Harvard researchers found that eating meat increases the risk of getting type 2 diabetes in women.

      1.4.11.3. Con:
      Amy Keating, a dietitian from Consumer Reports, says, "Many people replace the meat with refined carbohydrates," (Nov. 2017 Consumer Reports [497]), and these types of vegetarians have an increased risk of heart disease by 32%.

        1.4.11.3.1. Pro:
        Refined carbs/sugars are definitely not a suitable replacement for meat/dairy.  There is very little to be gained from substituting one unhealthy thing for another.

        1.4.11.3.2. Con:
        The statement that some of a group of people who are healthier because of not eating meat sometimes choose to eat unhealthy foods does not in any way make abstaining from meat a problem. Eating refined carbs or processed food is bad in and of itself regardless of vegan or not. This argument is comparable to saying that since some people who quit smoking chew more gum, then quitting smoking is bad for your teeth. In short, this is a non sequitur.

      1.4.11.4. Pro:
      A compound found in red meat, called carnitine [498], has been found to cause atherosclerosis, the hardening or clogging of the arteries.

        1.4.11.4.1. Con:
        It is mainly the consumption of fresh food [499] that has a positive effect, rather than whether they eat meat.

      1.4.11.5. Pro:
      Eating meat has recently been linked with developing Type 2 diabetes. [500]

      1.4.11.6. Con:
      Alternative factors, such as that vegetarians smoke less and have an overall healthier lifestyle [501], are strong alternative variables.

      1.4.11.7. Pro:
      Doctors often suggest vegetarian diets to help with hormonal chronic conditions like PCOS and Endometriosis. While the science of why is inexact, vegetarian diets seem to help alleviate symptoms.

      1.4.11.8. Con:
      Stopping eating meat can lead to more illness. It has been shown [502] that people who don't eat meat present more allergic, carcinogenic and cardiovascular pathologies than meat consumers.

        1.4.11.8.1. Con:
        A study [503] out from University of Southern California found that eating a diet rich in animal proteins (red meat, chicken, dairy)  during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer than someone on a low animal-protein diet — a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking.

        1.4.11.8.2. Con:
        Dr. Barnard (president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM)) discovered that eating meat is consistently associated with an elevated diabetes risk, regardless of age. Reference [504]

        1.4.11.8.3. Con:
        A recent analysis [505] of seven studies by PCRM demonstrates that a vegetarian diet reduces the risk of hypertension.

        1.4.11.8.4. Con:
        High consumption of red meats has been shown to be associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease sciencedirect.com [506].

      The lead cause of diabetes type ll is eating read meat, its actually the first link and it is as toxic for our organism as cigarettes are. You can watch it on the WHO website.harvardmagazine.com [509] you can see the first fact in here by Harvard University researchers, which I consider are highly recommended

      1.4.11.10. Pro:
      Vegetarians [510] have lower blood pressure, are less likely to be overweight, and have less chance of heart diseases.

        1.4.11.10.1. Pro:
        According to a peer-reviewed study of 76,000 people, vegetarians had 24% lower mortality [511] from heart disease than meat eaters.

        1.4.11.10.2. Pro:
        A 2006 meta-study [512] that compiled data from 87 studies found that vegetarian diets are associated with reduced body weight.

        1.4.11.10.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.11.8.4.

    1.4.12. Pro:
    Meat consists of a lot of protein. Therefore, its consumption leads to increased intake of protein. The China Study [513] measured the ideal daily intake to be 8 to 10 percent, whereas most people consume twice as much.

      1.4.12.1. Con:
      The eating of meat increased in the verge of WWII and the farming of animals was exacerbated; however this was due to  consumer demand. It's very difficult to build political measures for consumption reduction unless it's a global measure. The greater power is the market, the second is the consumer.

        1.4.12.1.1. Con:
        The consumers create the market. Without supply there would be no demand, and the change would naturally be gradual, letting the animal product market gently fade, transition, and evolve to meet the new needs of this earth.

    1.4.13. Con:
    Meat effectively delivers important nutrients for humans.

      1.4.13.1. Pro:
      Meat is a great source [514] of heme iron, which is important for the human body.

        1.4.13.1.1. Pro:
        Too little iron causes iron [515]-deficiency anemia, a decline of red blood cells. Without sufficient iron, the human body is not able to produce enough hemoglobin, the important oxygen carrier. Symptoms are weakness, fatigue and irritation.

        1.4.13.1.2. Pro:
        The body absorbs 15% to 35% of the heme iron in meat, but only absorbs 2% to 20% of the non-heme iron found in vegetarian sources like leafy greens and beans. (vegetarian.procon.org [516])

        1.4.13.1.3. Con:
        Iron is an oxidant and can harm the DNA of our cells. Non-heme (vegetable) iron is safer for us, since the body can absorb only what it needs, unlike heme iron. nutritionfacts.org [517]

        1.4.13.1.4. Pro:
        Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world. [518]

      1.4.13.2. Pro:
      Meat is the best source of vitamin B12 [519], a vitamin necessary for the nervous system and digestive system health.

        1.4.13.2.1. Con:
        Even if B-12 cannot be sourced directly from one's diet, supplements are widely available in many health-food stores and chemists.

          1.4.13.2.1.1. Pro:
          Many breakfast cereals, vegetable milks, and other products are fortified with B-12 [520].

        1.4.13.2.2. Pro:
        Meat is the most accessible source of those vitamins, particularly in poor countries. Growing chickens is the easiest way to get more rich in vitamins food [521].

        1.4.13.2.3. Con:
        Vitamin B-12 is also found [522] in eggs, dairy, fortified cereals and soya products, and yeast extract.

        1.4.13.2.4. Pro:
        Supplements are less accessible than meat to most people.

          1.4.13.2.4.1. Con:
          This may change as technology, societal/moral standards, and human behaviour change and evolve.

        1.4.13.2.5. Con:
        There are only rare cases of vitamin B12 deficiencies and mostly this is no problem [523] or easy to fix.

          1.4.13.2.5.1. Con:
          Vitamin B12 deficiency is not rare but extremely undiagnosed due to doctors not running serum tests routinely. The serum tests aren't quite accurate either and functional ranges vary between countries. There are more sensitive markers for B12 deficiency that are now available including methylmalonic acid (MMA), measured both in the serum or the urine...there’s another marker called holotranscobalamin II (or holoTC) mostly used in Europe but is way more accurate. chriskresser.com [524]

      1.4.13.3. Con:
      Vegetarians/vegans generally consume a diet consisting of less [525] saturated fat and cholesterol than the average meat eater.

        1.4.13.3.1. Con:
        There is next to no scientific evidence [526] that a high-fat diet leads to a high cholesterol level; in fact, a high-fat diet turns out to be healthy in many ways.

          1.4.13.3.1.1. Pro:
          Many if not most hunter-gatherer societies ate a higher fat diet than is currently recommended by Western governments [527]. Our understanding of human nutrition is far from complete. in this context, following a higher fat diet is a less risky proposition than following a low fat diet.

        1.4.13.3.2. Con:
        A high cholesterol level [528] has not been finally determined to be the cause of coronary heart diseases; there has merely been found a correlation. Latest research counters the assumption that a high cholesterol level is concerning.

      1.4.13.4. Pro:
      Without a carefully balanced diet non-meat eaters could suffer from certain deficiencies, like protein [529] or vitamin B12 [530].

        1.4.13.4.2. Con:
        Non-meat eaters have enough protein sources [531] they can choose from, such as eggs, soya, beans and nuts.

        1.4.13.4.3. Con:
        One of the foods with the highest [532] protein to calorie ratio is cheese, which is not a meat product.

          1.4.13.4.3.1. Con:
          No one is realistically going to replace all their sources of meat for cheese.

            1.4.13.4.3.1.1. Pro:
            Meat is embedded in many traditions and cultures [533]. Together with dietary restrictions associated to lactose intolerance, cheese would hardly replace meat.

          1.4.13.4.3.2. Con:
          This effectively excludes people who can’t eat cheese (i.e lactose intolerant, allergies, etc.).

          1.4.13.4.3.3. Con:
          The top four foods referenced in the article are all meat. Non-fat cheese is not commonly consumed.

        Animal protein stimulates hormones such as IGF-1, which can be used by cancer to fuel growth.nutritionfacts.org [536]

        1.4.13.6.4. Con:
        Food conversion makes loss of valuable protein. Every animal used for meat needs a larger amount of (plant based) protein in their food than the amount of protein it produces. To grow 1 (eatable) kg in meat cow must eat somewhere between 25kgs [537] and 35kgs [538] plant based feed. Although not all of that food is usable for human consumption a lot of it is. This is a terrible loss of valuable nutrients.

      1.4.13.7. Pro:
      Maintaining a meatless diet in a meat-eating society is costly and requires nutrient planning.

        1.4.13.7.1. Pro:
        Many of the minerals/vitamins found in meat are not in easily digestible forms from other sources.

        1.4.13.7.2. Con:
        If society as a whole transitions away from eating meat, there will be more support structures and systems in place to make alternative sources of nutrition more viable.

        1.4.13.7.3. Con:
        Most staple vegetarian foods, like beans and rice, are very cheap. Meat is expensive. Vitamin b12, the main problem for vegetarian diets can be supplemented cheaply.

      1.4.13.8. Pro:
      Rapid evolution of humans was directly supported by the high protein diet of eating meat.  Meat diets provide more energy and nutrients that are more filling and energy efficient than plant based diets. Thus, precious time and energy is saved with the more efficient meat diet. Time and energy that can be used for different things like evolution, education, and technological advancements.

        1.4.13.8.1. Pro:
        Many scientists point to the time at which humans began to eat meat as a major event in humanity's evolution. It contributed to a drastic increase in our intelligence, according to Leslie Aiello, an anthropologist and director of the Wenner-Gren Foundation in this NPR article [539].

          1.4.13.8.1.1. Con:
          This does not mean that continuing to eat meat will necessarily have any ongoing positive effects on humans.

        1.4.13.8.2. Con:
        Other claims elsewhere already dispute the suggestion that meats are faster and more efficient to cook and eat in modern society.

      1.4.13.9. Pro:
      Vegetables do not sufficiently contain the nutrition needed by the human species, and additionally the much larger space requirements because of lower caloric density mean that relying on vegetation alone is not likely to be feasible, especially in comparison with the feasibility of creating ethically sound animal husbandry conditions and even changing to use less-neurologically-complex organisms as food sources, such as shrimp and aquaponics.

      1.4.13.10. Con:
      There is no one-size-fits-all regiment for optimal health and nutrition for human beings. It may very well be that some of us are more genetically wired to thrive on vegetable only diets while others need to metabolize meat.

      1.4.13.11. Con:
      Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine [540] notes that when people switch from meat-eating to plant-eating, their intake of vitamins and other nutrients improves.

      1.4.13.12. Con:
      Plant protein products are improving. You can receive the same levels of proteins and vitamins without the chemicals and hormones found in meat products. thrivemarket.com [541]

      1.4.13.13. Pro:
      It is difficult and more expensive to achieve the protein requirements for best possible health without eating meat.

        1.4.13.13.1. Con:
        If plant-based protein sources become more widely accepted and produced, they will be cheaper and easier to obtain.

        1.4.13.13.2. Pro:
        Animal proteins are complete proteins and thus a more efficient source of amino acids.

      1.4.13.14. Pro:
      It may be arguable that essential nutrients in meat are generally more bioavailable from those sources. For example, omega-3, choline. It is also arguable that mineral balances such as copper-zinc that are recommended for health are identical to that which one would receive from a meat heavier diet, rather than plants. Likewise saturated fats serve essential roles in the composition of hormones, in the brain, heart and liver. In other words, in the long run, a vegan diet may be harmful.

        1.4.13.14.1. Con:
        Nutrient supplements are available in today's society, and are widely used to supplement a vegetarian or vegan diet.

          1.4.13.14.1.1. Pro:
          When more people stop eating meat it will be more interesting to produce better and more affordable supplements.

        1.4.13.14.2. Con:
        The typical diets of meat eaters have a lot of evidence showing them to be harmful [542] and have a particularly strong association to diseases of affluence. For example, heart disease, which is caused by atherosclerosis, the build up of plaque in the arteries. Erectile dysfunction is an early warning sign of atherosclerosis (by the age of 40, there is a 40% chance of ED which then goes up 10% a year). [543]

      1.4.13.16. Pro:
      Meat is essential for a healthy diet, especially for developing and maintaining muscles.

        1.4.13.16.1. Con:
        Meat is not 'essential'. All nutrients found in meat can be found in plants, bacteria or can be made within the human body.

          1.4.13.16.1.1. Con:
          Vegetarians and vegans are more likely to be deficient in Vitamin B12 [544].

        1.4.13.16.2. Con:
        Many world class athletes follow a vegan diet [545], proving that meat is not essential for developing and maintaining muscles.

      1.4.13.17. Pro:
      Meat has been shown to be an important component [546] of a balanced diet.

        1.4.13.17.2. Con:
        -> See 1.4.6.3.

      1.4.13.18. Pro:
      The bioavailability of vegetable matter is much lower than meat for human beings. Not only is meat cellular tissue far more similar in constitution to our own cells than plant cells, but it is far easier, for example, to extract the majority of iron available in red meat than it is for us to extract iron present in vegetation such as spinach, only a small fraction of which is available.

      1.4.13.19. Pro:
      Ceasing to eat meat can lead to health problems as replacing it with plant-based materials requires a plethora of different types of plants to get every nutrient needed.

      1.4.13.20. Pro:
      Eating meat is good for the brain (check the link), and nutrients are absorbed easier (see how cows spend all the day chewing grass). www.businessinsider.com [547]

      1.4.13.21. Con:
      There are more efficient and sustainable methods for putting nutrients into our body than eating meat. These include synthesizing nutrients from chemicals [548], modifying existing foods to use less resources [549] or have more nutrients [550], and individually growing food [551]. Way out there is people being genetically enhanced to become autotrophs [552].

      1.4.13.22. Pro:
      There is some evidence [553] that ceasing to eat meat would harm brains of those who are in the developmental age.

      1.4.13.23. Pro:
      A Stone Age diet is the most natural and beneficial diet to the human gut. Meat and fats and some grains and fruit. Studies have shown that those people who follow this ancient way of eating are less susceptible to diabetes, heart disease and cancers. Take a look at this article which shows how fat is very important to the human diet.files.meetup.com [554]

      1.4.13.24. Pro:
      Animals process a vegetarian diet. Meat is the effect of that process - and this is why meat packs more nutrients in than vegetables. The organs and bones of the animal are particularly high in essential nutrients.

      1.4.13.25. Pro:
      Eating just the cooked muscle is unhealthy. When meat is cured it increases it's bio availability and introduces good bacteria which facilitates digestion; coupled with eating bone broth and organs, eating meat in this way is extremely healthy.

      1.4.13.26. Pro:
      Some of the most healthful nutrients come exclusively or in greater bioavailability from animals sources: liver containing CoQ10, B vitamins, zinc, iron, chromium and other trace minerals, bone broth containing collagen supporting compounds such as hyluronic acid and glucosamine. While vegetarian diets can be healthful, they lack many nutrients that, while present in vegetables, have much less bioavailability. Humans thrive only when consuming moderate amounts of healthy animal food sources.

      1.4.13.27. Con:
      The human body does not require consumption of animal protein.

        1.4.13.27.1. Con:
        Just because the human body can live without eating meat doesn't rationalize living without it, nor does it justify that something is unhealthy.

        1.4.13.27.2. Pro:
        All the high-quality amino acid proteins [555] we require are readily available in plants such as buckwheat, quinoa and potatoes.

        1.4.13.27.3. Con:
        Eating meat or being able to live optimally without it or on alternative diets has been shown to be coded at a genetic level and this varies from one human to another. It is not always a simple moral or lifestyle choice.

        1.4.13.27.4. Pro:
        There are enough non-animal protein [556] sources humans can consume.

        1.4.13.27.5. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.6.3.3.

      1.4.13.28. Con:
      Though there may be some health benefits associated with eating meat, many [557] humans typically eat much more of it than is healthy or necessary to obtain such benefits.

      1.4.13.29. Con:
      Good fats [558] come mainly from vegetables, nuts, seeds; not from meat.

        1.4.13.29.1. Con:
        It is highly debatable what fats are good and which are bad. We have been living under a lot of assumptions about fat. Polyunsaturated oils are chemically less stable than saturated fats. What if its all been a big fat lie. [559]
        Saturated fat is safe… this is the science that says so [560]

      1.4.13.30. Con:
      A meatless diet helps build healthy bones because vegetarians absorb more calcium than meat eaters.

        1.4.13.30.1. Pro:
        There are many sources of healthy vegetarian calcium [561] including tofu, dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens, as well as fortified cereals.

        1.4.13.30.2. Con:
        A meatless diet does not guarantee a higher absorbtion of calcium, because vegetarians can also eat unhealthy food and maintain an unbalanced diet.

        1.4.13.30.3. Pro:
        Meat has high renal acid levels which the body must neutralize by leaching calcium [562] from the bones, which is then passed into urine and lost.

    1.4.14. Con:
    Avoidance of all meat is a luxury good, only realistic in a healthy manner, in rich societies. In poor societies practicing vegetarianism, it often correlates with malnutrition. In most societies, this claim is both arrogant and moralizing, condemning poor countries to malnutrition, contributing to expanding in equality.

      1.4.14.1. Pro:
      Even nowadays the meat is still needed for human survival [563]. We, the golden billion, can afford to choose. The rest of the world can not. So only after complete worldwide victory over the global problem of hunger we can afford to debate about what type of food should we choose to eat. But even then the humanity would just not have any possibilities to produce enough vegetarian food for all of our fast-growing population. It may be good, but it's simply impossible on this step of human evolution.

    1.4.15. Pro:
    Vegetarian foods are nutritionally superior to meat.

      1.4.15.1. Con:
      -> See 1.4.13.

      1.4.15.2. Pro:
      Healthy vegetarian foods clean your teeth while you eat (called "detergent foods" for that purpose) [564].

      1.4.15.3. Pro:
      Per pound, spirulina has over double the protein of chicken (261g [565] vs 113g [566])

      1.4.15.4. Pro:
      Vegetarian food is high in beneficial nutrients (such as Vitamin K [567] and magnesium [568]) whereas meat is high in unhealthier ones (such as calories and cholesterol [569]) when in excess

        1.4.15.4.1. Pro:
        The Vitamin K2 (more absorbable form) amounts are the highest (lb for lb) in the vegan food natto (over 1mg while the meat runner up is under 0.4mg [570]).

      1.4.15.5. Con:
      The fat in plants is generally high in polyunsaturated fat which is unstable leading to inflammation and oxidation in the body vs saturated fats in meat. westonaprice.org [571]

      1.4.15.6. Con:
      People who eat meat can also eat vegetarian food. They benefit from both.

    1.4.16. Pro:
    Meat is dangerous in that it increases the risk of injuries to those who eat meat.

      1.4.16.1. Pro:
      Ingesting "bones can lead to intestinal perforation and peritonitis [572]"

      1.4.16.2. Pro:
      Beef jerky increases tooth pain and possibly triggers temporomandibular joint (TMJ) [573]

      1.4.16.3. Pro:
      Meat trapped in-between teeth (i.e. food impaction) can be a reason for sore gums. [574]

      1.4.16.4. Pro:
      Grilled food usually is associated with meat (burgers, hot dogs, steak...). Wire brushes for cleaning a grill expose people to possibly ingesting the bristles and having emergency situations (i.e. GI tract injuries) [575]

      1.4.16.5. Pro:
      Deboning fish by-mouth can lead to injuries such as nose bleeds, choking, and facial puncturing [576].

      1.4.16.6. Pro:
      Knives pose a danger to eaters from meats that require cutting before eating. In Spain, "60,000 Spaniards end up in emergency rooms each year because of ham-cutting accidents [577]".

      1.4.16.7. Pro:
      People can chip their teeth from biting into bone. [578]

      1.4.16.8. Con:
      Some of these could occur while eating vegan foods too, such as cutting large and tough-skinned fruits and vegetables.

      1.4.16.9. Con:
      Blenders used to make vegetarian foods (such as smoothies) cause emergency room visits [579].

    1.4.17. Pro:
    Meat-eaters suffer more frequently from various types of food poisoning [580] than vegetarians.

      1.4.17.1. Pro:
      According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 70% of food poisoning is caused by contaminated animal flesh [581].

      1.4.17.2. Con:
      The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) published in a report [582] that leafy green vegetables like lettuce or spinach are among the top sources of food poisoning.

        1.4.17.2.1. Pro:
        Between 1998 and 2008, 46% of all cases of food poisoning [583] in the USA were caused by leafy green vegetables.

        1.4.17.2.2. Pro:
        Leafy green vegetables cause 80% of all E.coli [584] cases in the USA.

        1.4.17.2.3. Con:
        According to the same study, poultry was responsible for the most deaths, affecting 19% of fatal cases. Meat and poultry combined were responsible for 29% of deaths. So, despite the frequency of vegetable-related illnesses, they were not the most harmful.

        1.4.17.2.4. Con:
        Officials from the CDC have emphasized that most of the vegetable-related sicknesses came from norovirus, often passed by food handlers and cooks. Thus, contamination is more related to how the kitchen or restaurant handles the food, rather than the actual food itself.

      1.4.17.3. Con:
      Seedy vegetables (tomatoes, zucchinis) are responsible for more Salmonella [585] infections than any kind of meat in the USA.

      1.4.17.4. Con:
      Food poisoning occurs in cases of poor preparation of food and poor food hygiene. There is nothing more inherently risky in eating meat than in eating vegetables.

      1.4.17.5. Con:
      In terms of severity (hospitalizations and deaths) vegetarian diets offer no significant advantage for avoiding food poisoning. Hospitalizations and deaths (wwwnc.cdc.gov [586]) are mostly due to listeria, salmonella, and toxoplasma gondii. None of these have any particular vegetarian advantages.

      1.4.17.6. Con:
      The largest food poisoning disasters (dwarfing all others) are chemical contamination of grain products. For example the 
      Iraq poison grain disaster [587] or this case of toxic cooking oil in spain [588].

    1.4.18. Con:
    Whether or not people have better or worse health outcomes due to their diet is irrelevant to the claim that people should completely stop eating meat. It is only an argument to restructure health policy to reduce meat consumption or encourage veganism.

      1.4.18.1. Pro:
      This has no bearing on the ethical question of whether it is wrong to eat meat, unless you are going to say that it is morally wrong to eat anything that is less healthy than vegetables (or at least anything that is not healthier than meat). But no one says that it's morally wrong to ever eat a french fry.

    1.4.19. Con:
    Meat consumption itself is not unhealthy. It strongly depends on the amount [589] consumed as well as its origin - whether it is from industrial livestock farming or organic farming.

      1.4.19.1. Pro:
      The feeding of antibiotics, faulty food and the unhygienic conditions in industrial livestock farming makes meat produced this way unhealthy for humans.

      1.4.19.2. Pro:
      Eating meat involves a tradeoff between pleasure and health consequences. Individuals are capable of evaluating that tradeoff for themselves, and may often legitimately decide to eat meat despite the health consequences.

        1.4.19.2.1. Pro:
        Health considerations are generally not the main factor when deciding what to eat or not. Otherwise we would drink cockroach milk [590] and stop eating french fries.

          1.4.19.2.1.1. Con:
          Because they are not the main factor does not mean they should not be the main factor.

          1.4.19.2.1.2. Con:
          Not everything that contains nutrients is inherently "healthy".

          1.4.19.2.1.3. Con:
          And maybe we should stop eating French fries, and get on that cockroach milk (which would not in fact be harvested from actual cockroaches, as per the link) thing.

        1.4.19.2.2. Con:
        Unhealthy choices lead to poor health outcomes which will then need to be managed by the healthcare system, placing a burden on society in general.

        1.4.19.2.3. Con:
        It is also likely down to convenience and societal norms. Award winning vegan foods have beaten meat products on taste, such as the Impossible Burger [591], meaning that this level of pleasure is not exclusive to real meat.

        1.4.19.2.4. Con:
        Recreational substances are also banned; there is precedent for restricting pleasurable, yet health-damaging goods.

          1.4.19.2.4.1. Pro:
          Knowingly and deliberately ruining or at least risking one's own health is not a victimless crime, nor self-contained - the victim is society at large, as it must now pay for one's health care and divert a portion of the health care system's resources to the irresponsible person.

          1.4.19.2.4.2. Con:
          Most recreational substances which are harmful enough to be banned are significantly more harmful than meat. For example, alcohol and cigarettes are legal in most places, and are more harmful than meat.

        1.4.19.2.5. Pro:
        Most meat-eaters consume meat not to maintain a healthy diet, but because it increases their subjective quality of life.

          1.4.19.2.5.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.

          1.4.19.2.5.2. Con:
          Their subjective quality of life would be reduced if they get sick because of an unhealthy diet.

        1.4.19.2.6. Pro:
        Humans drink alcohol for its toxic effect. Therefore, health is not the based upon a single food item, but as a whole as the entire diet should be considered when talking about health.

      1.4.19.3. Pro:
      Whilst there are some fats associated with say, heart disease, particularly those in beef, and dairy, and processed meats are linked with cancer - heart disease does not occur in high degrees in all meat heavy national diets, such as Spain, not cancer in unprocessed meat diets. Where bad heart seems to be most clustered I think, is in nations with heavy fast food diets like the US - the combination of high starch, high sugar, and high saturated fat and processed meats.

      1.4.19.4. Con:
      No diet is without risk to health. Most sugars are known to have worse effects on cholesterol levels than any meat, and this also means fruits and vegetables! However, it may be sugar in meat that makes it so unhealthy — meat from many species is found to have toxic sugars Neu5Gc responsible for inflammation and autoimmune disorders, and possible links to cancer. In the end, whole unprocessed vegetables appear to be the best way to absorb carbohydrates slowly and avoid many of these issues.

        1.4.19.4.1. Con:
        These are facts coming from in vitro studies without any ecological reliability and with concentrations way higher than the ones we assume.

      1.4.19.5. Pro:
      Eating a little amount of meat permits to have a balanced diet without the inconvenience of nutritional lack and guarantee a higher quality of life for the animals

    1.4.20. Con:
    Vegetarian diets are only more beneficial for the health of an individual if they are well balanced [592], and if compared to an unbalanced omnivorous diet. [593] The essence in the question of health is not that which is more healthier: eating, or not eating animal related products, but the overall quality and composition of a diet.

    1.4.21. Con:
    A substantial population require meat in their diet for health reasons, as thousands of stories show [594].

    1.4.22. Con:
    All diets [595] generally lead to better health outcomes compared to people who do not follow a restrictive diet, because people on a diet make conscious decisions about their food.

    1.4.23. Con:
    A vegetarian diet might lead to better health outcomes, but for some who live in countries where getting vegan/vegetarian food easily isn't an option, a non-veg diet is a trade off between health and convenience.

    1.4.24. Con:
    The fact [596] that vegetarians live longer (up to nine years) is not only due to their meatless diet, but also to the fact that they are more likely to exercise, smoke less and drink less alcohol.

      1.4.24.1. Pro:
      Correlation does not indicate causation.

      1.4.24.2. Pro:
      This misconception is the result of a self-selection bias. Basically, vegetarians are all people who are unusually interested in their health to begin with. Thus, naive studies will tend to show that vegetarians are healthier regardless of whether vegetarianism is healthy.

        1.4.24.2.1. Con:
        There is no guarantee that all vegetarians are necessarily people who are unusually interested in their health to begin with. People may choose a vegetarian lifestyle out of moral concerns, or many other reasons.

  1.5. Pro:
  Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.

    1.5.1. Con:
    It is now possible to grow meat without the animal, therefore this argument's effectiveness is beginning to diminish.

    1.5.2. Con:
    While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources (i.e. free range farming) that afford animals the same (if not better) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.

      1.5.2.1. Pro:
      Unlike wild animals, farmed animals are born explicitly due to human action. While we may have a duty to ensure that their lives are not unnecessarily cruel, it is not immoral to kill them for our own ends given they would not have existed otherwise.

        1.5.2.1.1. Pro:
        As long as these animals are given a reasonable quality of life, it is preferable that they get the opportunity to exist given to them by humans for the purpose of farming. In the alternative, many animals do not get to exist at all.

          1.5.2.1.1.1. Con:
          People who don't eat meat give animals a better quality of life while avoiding the majority of conditions and situations that are caused by meat producing farmers. Thus, the terms of existence are better managed by the people that consider sentience above digestion. Most noticeably, the inferior existence and situation is massively created by industrially breeding domesticated animals into being.

          1.5.2.1.1.2. Con:
          Bringing an entity into existence does not mean that you have the ability to use that entity for whatever purpose you want.

            1.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro:
            That's like saying it's a parent's right to be abusive by virtue of causing their child's birth. The basic rights of any living creature are not affected by the circumstances of its birth.

            1.5.2.1.1.2.2. Pro:
            This renders the concept of birth as giving claim to another life as being property to do with as one pleases. Ownership/property mentality as a form of colonialism was used for generations to rationalize the abuse of animals, children, women, other races, religions, under the concept that another is property to the person, group or country who feeds, employs or "owns" it, putting that life under their control. We have since implemented laws to counter abuses perpetrated under this philosophy.

            1.5.2.1.1.2.3. Pro:
            All humans are also born due to the actions and decisions of their parents. It is not subsequently moral to treat them however you wish to meet your own ends. Once a living being is alive, they should be subject to the same standard of morality that empathy drives us to apply to human children. Empathy naturally decreases the further from our species an animal gets, but we have empathy for them regardless.

        1.5.2.1.2. Con:
        The lives of most animals in factory farms are plausibly worse than not existing, so it is immoral to bring them into existence.

          1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.15.3.1.3.1.

          1.5.2.1.2.2. Pro:
          Certain diseases become more prevalent due to the cramped conditions in "factory" farming.

          1.5.2.1.2.3. Pro:
          Chickens are commonly de-beaked without anaesthesia, a process which is extremely painful for them.

        1.5.2.1.3. Con:
        It is immoral to bring creatures into existence in order to use and kill them. For example, it would be immoral to give birth to new children and use them as slaves or food.

          1.5.2.1.3.1. Con:
          This is because humans have special, higher-order rights - for example, a right to freedom. Animals do not have these rights, so it is permissible to breed them for certain uses.

            1.5.2.1.3.1.1. Con:
            Human rights only emerged through generations of human individuals failing to seek or achieve those rights. Rights are achieved by ending oppression. As exemplified by historical freedom stories, the worthiness of animals for rights is the matter under examination when weighing the morality of killing them for food.

              1.5.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
              The mere fact that human rights were created through the removal of oppression does not mean that animals are analogous to previously oppressed groups of humans.

            1.5.2.1.3.1.2. Con:
            Animals don't lack rights, and even if they did, they shouldn't. We should consider cruelty to animals immoral for the same reason we consider cruelty to humans immoral. It is an affront to the empathy we share with living beings.

          1.5.2.1.3.2. Con:
          This is an anthropomorphic analogy.  It is a trait of human psychology and one in this case which is incorrect.  Comparing a human child to a feed lot animal is unbalanced in value. A feed lot animal if left in it's natural condition consumes plants and in turn is consumed by other animals. If humans were not eating them they would be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild. Their condition in life does not change much between feed lot and field.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.1. Con:
            Animals in the wild have freedom of movement and other increased choices not available to farm animals. Quality of life is not decided purely by length or absence of suffering, or how its end is met.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.2. Con:
            Boredom (such as that caused by monotonous, unchanging, restricted enclosures) can also be suffering, and can cause stress or frustration in animals (which can in turn lead to them attacking each other, especially when enclosures are also too small). At the very least, it reduces the quality of their lives.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.3. Con:
            As discussed earlier, these animals are bred specifically for human consumption. If humans had not created these animals, they could not possibly "be eaten by other predators/scavengers in the wild."

            1.5.2.1.3.2.4. Con:
            "Unbalanced in value" is dubious. By what objective measure of value are you using? You are basing the value of a life on their potential to achieve some human-centric measure of worth. A feral human left in the wild, or a mentally handicapped child, is of equal value to a penned sheep then.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.5. Con:
            Who is to argue when anthropomorphising is or isn't wrong? Blacks were enslaved because they were just brutes. Then one day we anthropomorphised them. Voila, suddenly rights are bestowed.

              1.5.2.1.3.2.5.1. Con:
              Many indigenous peoples had broad arts, culture, and tradition, and sophisticated societies involving living in harmony with the land, other animals, and each other. Often this was a reasoned process developed and passed down through generations (much like our own technology!), not merely instinctual. Deliberately moderating your group's consumption in the name of sustainability, for instance, is hardly a "brutish" trait or culture. It is not "anthropomorphizing" to recognize genuine virtues.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.6. Con:
            For this statement to be true every animal which is prey would end their lives at the hands of a predator. In fact most survive to experience a natural cause of death.

              1.5.2.1.3.2.6.1. Con:
              Every animal is consumed by a scavenger of some kind though, some even microbial in nature, as originally stated. Therefore there is little difference between humans eating animals, and other wild life. If it is not immoral for a predator to eat prey, then it is not immoral for humans to eat animals as well.

            1.5.2.1.3.2.7. Con:
            Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to animals. There is no such attribution in the claim.

              1.5.2.1.3.2.7.1. Con:
              Domesticated animals are at risk of predators/scavengers.  Predator management and protection is a core concern of raising livestock.

          1.5.2.1.3.3. Pro:
          Granting sentient existence just to revoke it is arguably the cruelest act one can rationalize. That is "playing god" to its worst possible meaning.

          1.5.2.1.3.4. Pro:
          -> See 1.5.2.1.1.2.

        1.5.2.1.4. Pro:
        If we cease eating meat then millions of animals will never be born at all. We cannot be certain that animals would prefer to never be born than to die prematurely.

          1.5.2.1.4.1. Con:
          An animal that isn't born can't prefer to be born at all as they don't exist. An animal that exists currently doesn't want to die prematurely (they actively avoid pain). Since we know they don't want to die (avoid pain) it is ethical not to harm them. If we create animals to kill (harm) we are acting unethically.

          1.5.2.1.4.2. Con:
          It is true that animal intelligence exists and should be considered no matter where it scores relative to ours. Since we do not know if they prefer to live a little before being killed, we should not assume they would, especially because factory farming living conditions are not even good in the first place.

        1.5.2.1.5. Con:
        The farming process is far from cruelty-free. As unanimous ethical farming seems to be impossible in our global capitalist climate the easiest way to ensure ethical treatment of animals is to take part in a widespread movement to stop supporting farmed meat.

        1.5.2.1.6. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.1.1.2.

        1.5.2.1.7. Pro:
        Domestication was a "social contract" between the two species: humans obtained a mobile source of food and cloth and the animals were assured basic necessities and protection from natural predators and a guaranteed way to spread their genes. In the present, domesticated animals can be considered the most "successful" species, with 0 probability of becoming extinct, while many "free" wild animals starve and are less able to reproduce.

          1.5.2.1.7.1. Con:
          A social contract implies a mutual benefit. The relationship between domesticated animals and their human captures is not a mutually beneficial relationship. Animals raised for slaughter are artificially selected for traits that humans value, which inhibit the animal's ability to survive in the wild. Each of our domesticated species suffers from various illnesses and conditions that are a direct result of captivity and human exploitation.

        1.5.2.1.8. Pro:
        To not eat an animal who dedicated it's entire life so that it can be consumed is not only wasteful but disrespectful towards that animal's sacrifice to sustain us.

          1.5.2.1.8.1. Con:
          The goal of not eating meat is not to help an animal that has already been slaughtered, but to reduce demand and thus production of meat in the long term.

          1.5.2.1.8.2. Con:
          The animal has not made a choice to dedicate it's life to humankind nor has it chosen to sacrifice itself to sustain us. We have made the choice to kill it.

      1.5.2.2. Con:
      -> See 1.5.2.1.3.

      1.5.2.3. Con:
      Every sentient animal has the same moral status. You therefore can't treat pigs and cows as means to an end if you can't treat humans as means to an end.

        1.5.2.3.1. Con:
        We treat everybody who provides us with services (e.g. plumbers) as means to our ends.

          1.5.2.3.1.1. Con:
          We don't treat their existences as means to our ends, but we enter into a contract (which they freely and clearly accept) with them for their services. Treating their existences as means to our ends would mean to enslave them.

        1.5.2.3.2. Con:
        We should measure the morality of our actions towards animals on whether we fulfil their desires while they are alive, not on an abstract logical deduction regarding the nature of sentience. Pigs, for example, want to wallow in the mud, eat, reproduce, and have a painless death; we can fulfil all those desires and also eat the pigs afterwards, thus we can, morally, treat them as a means to an end.

          1.5.2.3.2.1. Con:
          Pigs (and most other animals) only desire death when they are already in pain or distress, otherwise their actions in pursuing continued survival indicate they would prefer to live on indefinitely.

      1.5.2.4. Pro:
      Eating meat is not cruel and immoral if the animals that are being consumed are provided with humane living conditions, able to live full lives, and die of natural causes.

        1.5.2.4.1. Pro:
        Animals are currently being treated horribly, but many meat eaters are using their sway as actual consumers to improve animals' living conditions. This combined attention and sway is sure to help animal rights in the long run.

          1.5.2.4.1.1. Pro:
          If we were to outlaw meat 10 years ago, all the animals in the meat making process would probably be slaughtered to cut losses. In light of recent changes, it is plausible that in 10 years' time farm animals will be allowed to live beyond the time when they are 'useful'.

          1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro:
          Free range eggs [597] are taking over because they are more valuable then caged eggs.

          1.5.2.4.1.3. Pro:
          The organic beef market [598] is growing.

        1.5.2.4.2. Pro:
        Merely eating meat isn't cruel. What is cruel is the factory farm system we use to get the meat. If we can get the meat without causing undue pain to the animal, there is no issue.

          1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro:
          Eating meat, in and of itself, cannot be cruel. Cruel [599] is defined as willingly causing pain; unless you are eating the animal alive, it would be impossible to bring pain to a non-living piece of meat.

            1.5.2.4.2.1.1. Con:
            If you are an ongoing meat eater, you are contributing to the demand for meat that causes animals to be slaughtered, and so in the long run you are willingly causing pain to animals, even if not at the exact stage that you eat them.

            1.5.2.4.2.1.2. Con:
            If you eat an animal, you may not be directly inflicting pain upon it, but yours and the demand for meat among all consumers thereof, "caused" that death. If you and nobody else ate meat, there would be no money in farming it. Thus, meat eaters as a collective, do cause suffering and death, particularly with regards to factory farming.

          1.5.2.4.2.2. Pro:
          The act of eating meat being immoral implies an accepted morality by all involved.  This is a Naturalistic Fallacy [600], a logical fallacy which is unsupportable.  Saying the eating of meat is immoral is to impose moral value 'good' upon a natural act, eating (whatever it is).  For instance is it really the act of eating meat that is being called immoral or is it the slaughtering practices?

          1.5.2.4.2.3. Con:
          The meat must be sourced from somewhere. Even high welfare animal products and certifications involve some level of cruelty (for example, gassing male chicks as opposed to liquidising them in the egg industry - better, but hardly cruelty free). External monitoring of conditions can also be manipulated to put on a good show for the audits. By eating the meat, the consumer is complicit, just as using products made by slaves is tacitly supporting that industry.

        1.5.2.4.3. Pro:
        Cruelty, being a trait derived from the human mind, is only applicable to meat consumption if it is done irresponsibly as compared to other consumers of meat in the animal kingdom.

          1.5.2.4.3.1. Con:
          It can be argued that with higher levels of intelligence and moral reasoning, humans should be held to a higher standard than other predatory animals.

            1.5.2.4.3.1.1. Con:
            Possession of intelligence or moral reasoning do not imply the possession of the other.

              1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1. Con:
              Humans generally have more of both than most other animals.

                1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Morality and behavior are subjective, and subsequently not quantifiable. Therefore a being cannot have more or less of any such quality.

                  1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Humans have a greater ability to morally reason than, say, lions or crocodiles.

                    1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    Morality cannot be quantified.

                      1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                      There are many moral systems which have the goal of doing just that.

                1.5.2.4.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Actually, I think you mean to say humans have a moral capacity, while animals don't, they just follow their instincts.

              1.5.2.4.3.1.1.2. Pro:
              Defining ethics as the commonly accepted behavior or conduct of an intelligent being and defining morals as that which governs the definitions of right/good and wrong/evil, one should infer that the aforementioned are not synonymous. Therefore, no inference can be made for the possession of morals by an intelligent being or the possession of intelligence by a being of perceived morality.

        1.5.2.4.4. Con:
        Even free range farming violates the rights of animals by imprisoning them (albeit in a larger enclosure) and eventually killing them against their will.

        1.5.2.4.5. Pro:
        Eating meat and cruel/immoral treatment of animals are not mutually exclusive - one can exist without the other. Large farms or "reserves" where animals are able to live a full and healthy life is a possible example. Likewise, it could also be assumed that ending the suffering for animals who are injured or already dying is more humane and less wasteful than allowing their suffering or wasting their remains.

        1.5.2.4.6. Pro:
        Humans can make a choice to reduce the cruelty and immoral treatment of animals, as well as to reduce their consumption to a naturally sustainable amount.  This would be more likely to work if there weren't corporate "factories" for meat production--if humans were required to raise and/or hunt their own prey, and if there were distinct regulations disallowing and punishing animal cruelty on any spectrum.

        1.5.2.4.7. Con:
        Farm animals by definition cannot enjoy humane living conditions, since their freedom of movement will necessarily have to be violated.

          1.5.2.4.7.1. Con:
          Following this line of logic, animals will be perpetually imprisoned because either shorelines will prevent them from "moving freely" to other continents or the earth's finite nature prevents them from "moving freely" to other planets.

      1.5.2.5. Con:
      Animals cannot possibly enjoy the same quality of life that they'd have had in the wild if they were bred and raised with the sole purpose of being eaten.

        1.5.2.5.1. Con:
        Animals in the wild often endure a great deal of suffering due to violent deaths from predators, starvation, or exposure. A peaceful life on a farm is plausibly preferable to a life in the wild.

          1.5.2.5.1.1. Pro:
          Wild animals almost invariably suffer more than domesticated animals properly farmed. Even a wild animal suffering the relatively peaceful death of kidney failure will likely be awakened when carnivores and scavengers begin eating their helpless bodies alive. There is no end to a wild life that is not brutal.

            1.5.2.5.1.1.1. Con:
            -> See 1.5.2.1.3.2.1.

          1.5.2.5.1.2. Con:
          This is contingent on the farm in fact being ethical, and depending on exactly how it is run there are still plausible reasons why a life in the wild could be better.

            1.5.2.5.1.2.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.5.2.1.3.2.1.

            1.5.2.5.1.2.2. Pro:
            It is not just how an animal dies that matters, but how it lives. A free life, even one with a (temporarily) painful end, is arguably preferable to a life in a cage, especially when some of the more barbaric and cruel factory farming practices (de-beaking, other forms of un-anaesthetized mutilation, insufficient health care to prevent diseases from spreading across the herd, etc.) come into play.

              1.5.2.5.1.2.2.1. Con:
              This is a claim against factory farming, not eating meat. There are many ways to humanely raise and harvest the animals.

                1.5.2.5.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                Eating meat creates the demand which drives factory farming.

        1.5.2.5.2. Con:
        Domesticated animals, including animals raised for meat, show significantly lower levels of the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine than their wild counterparts [601].

        1.5.2.5.3. Con:
        If domesticated animals are raised ethically in a way as to have reasonable lives, then they are allowed to exist and experience life, where in a world without meat farming they probably would not.

          1.5.2.5.3.1. Con:
          We (humans) shouldn't be the ones to choose what kind of lives animals should have and there is no guarantee that "ethically raised animals" have better lives than those who live in the wild.

            1.5.2.5.3.1.1. Con:
            There is no guarentee that stock animals will have better lives in the wild either. If we released all the chickens out into the wild it is certain that they will not have a better life in any regard, thanks to foxes, wolves snakes, harsh environment etc etc. Chickens have not adapted to survive without human input and consumption.

          1.5.2.5.3.2. Con:
          Only animals that have died of a natural cause can, therefore, be used as meat, since there is no such thing as killing ethically an animal that wants to live.

        1.5.2.5.4. Pro:
        The rearing of animals need not be seen as 'solely for eating', with additional responsibilities requiring a reasonable life. If meat consumption ceased, it is unlikely the farm animals would be reintroduced to the wild, they would simply vanish from existence.

        1.5.2.5.5. Con:
        In the wild, there are no such concepts as compassion or malice. There is only nature, which is primal and brutal. A swift death at the hands of a hunter or farmer who will use the animal for food, clothing, etc. is a far better death than by natural predators, disease, or famine.

      1.5.2.6. Con:
      The "free range" designation is not well regulated in the United States, and is more of a marketing term than a true indicator of how animals are treated. There are no rules enforcing the quality, size or degree of access to the outside.

        1.5.2.6.1. Con:
        Free range labels could be reformed to allow consumers to eat meat ethically.

          1.5.2.6.1.1. Con:
          Then the responsible action would be to advocate for reform while abstaining from meat until reform succeeds.

        1.5.2.6.2. Pro:
        Enforcing such legislation would take time, resources, and labour hours (proportionate to its complexity). This would necessitate extra funding or taking from somewhere else.

      1.5.2.7. Con:
      Free range animals are often worse for the environment, as they are more resource intensive in terms of land and less efficient in terms of food conversion [602]. Meanwhile, lower welfare animals benefit from efficiency of scale (heat recapture in intensive farms for example). Meat eaters must choose between welfare and the environment. Vegans need not make such a choice.

      1.5.2.8. Pro:
      We can eat meat responsibly - choose carefully, develop small productions and local food, and make it a rare and savoured special dish.

        1.5.2.8.1. Con:
        This still entails killing animals for their meat, and likely breeding and raising them in captivity.

        1.5.2.8.2. Con:
        This would only work if all other meat production was stopped. Maybe stopping meat consumption in the present is the most effective way to get this to come about.

        1.5.2.8.3. Con:
        Small productions cannot compete with large ones because they are small. It's already the case that most farms are small but most animals come from big farms, so adding more small farms won't help. For example, in the US in 2012: 57% of farms with cattle sold less than 20 cattle each, while 4.6% of all cattle came from such farms. 0.9% of farms sold at least 1000 cattle each, while 51% of all cattle came from such farms. Source and more details and examples. [603]

      1.5.2.9. Pro:
      The best way to incentivise humane and quality meat production is to buy and eat more from local farms. Avoiding meat entirely causes industrial meat factories to cut costs even more, leading to even more unethical production. Vote with your money.

        1.5.2.9.1. Con:
        If nobody eats meat, nobody will buy meat, and all meat producers will go out of business - including and especially the unethical ones.

        1.5.2.9.2. Pro:
        If consumers stop eating meat altogether, then unethical meat producers know there is nothing they can do to get the demand back, so they do not change behaviour. If consumers switch to more ethical options, unethical producers are incentivised to produce more ethically.

      1.5.2.10. Con:
      Do means justify ends? We cannot argue the humaneness of raising animals for consumption when the end goal is their slaughter en masse anyway.

        1.5.2.10.1. Con:
        The humaneness of their treatment pre-slaughter is still relevant, as minimizing suffering is the end goal or one of the goals of many moral systems.

      1.5.2.11. Pro:
      What is actually wrong is the treatment of animals in the  "meat industry", not the meat-eating itself. So, a change in the meat "production" would solve the problem, in a way that makes ceasing to eat meat unnecessary.

        1.5.2.11.1. Con:
        Food production is fully integrated into capitalism, in which profits are always the priority. Unless/until that changes, this point is purely hypothetical/unrealistic.

      1.5.2.12. Con:
      Even under an 'ideal' farming circumstances (i.e. free range; painless death) killing an animal still violates its right to life. To do so for such as simple (and substitutable) need such as food is immoral.

        1.5.2.12.1. Con:
        Most animals lack essential prerequisites for the right to life, like self-awareness or the ability to have desires about the future. While they may have a right to be free of suffering, they do not have a right to life.

          1.5.2.12.1.1. Con:
          Claiming truth with no definition of the "right to life" or where this is a prerequisite to have desires about the future is not an argument. You have simply claimed these things as self evident truths. Also claimed animals are not self aware.  Which animals? Who said? When? etc.

          1.5.2.12.1.2. Con:
          Animals demonstrate their desires for the future through their actions. For example, they try to flee from danger and become panicked in slaughterhouses, so they clearly have specific desires about the future to not be killed.

          1.5.2.12.1.3. Con:
          One should err on giving more rights than less. Even if the essential prerequisites for rights are vague, we should err on respecting life rather than disrespecting it.

          1.5.2.12.1.4. Con:
          The main animal farming victims are examples of complex lifeforms that do not constitute borderline cases and should be given the right to life.

        1.5.2.12.2. Pro:
        Eating 'happy meat' (i.e. produced with less suffering) is still discrimination, because we would not eat happy meat from e.g. humans or dogs. Killing a happy person (e.g. a pig or human) in order to eat him or her, remains a violation of the right not to be used as a means against one's will.

        1.5.2.12.3. Pro:
        All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.

          1.5.2.12.3.1. Con:
          Some animals, who due to their reproduction disturb a natural balance, need to be killed in order to preserve biodiversity. This is the case with rabbits on the German island Norderney [604] where the rabbits were accidentally brought to the island by humans.

            1.5.2.12.3.1.1. Con:
            Because biodiversity is greatest with immediate levels of stress some environmental interference is desired. The overpopulation of rabbits on Norderney [605], for example, has positive effects.

            1.5.2.12.3.1.2. Con:
            Animals disturbing natural balance are generally the result of human actions (e.g. resettlement). It is not right to deny these animals their right to life, if it was indeed human actions that led to the disturbance of natural balance.

              1.5.2.12.3.1.2.1. Con:
              Not killing the introduced rabbits will destroy the natural ecosystems of Norderney and ultimately lead to the death or depopulation of its native wildlife. Humans have a responsibility to fix the consequences of their actions; particularly when it prevents even greater harms from occurring.

          Most animals whose meat is eaten have been the property of humans. Their property rights conflict with animal rights.

            1.5.2.12.3.2.1. Pro:
            That human rights outweigh animal rights is apparent in many legal circumstances.

              A driver is prohibited to make an emergency brake [606] for a cat when there is the danger of a collision with the car behind. Here human considerations weigh heavier than animal rights.

                1.5.2.12.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
                Human rights outweighing animal rights in situations where there is a choice between risking (or taking) a human life or an animal life is not the same as knowingly and deliberately mass factory-farming animals (under often cruel conditions) specifically for the consumption of humans.

              1.5.2.12.3.2.1.2. Pro:
              It is legal to shoot a gorilla when there is the potential, yet uncertain, danger [607] that a human will be harmed. This illustrates that human rights are more important than animal rights.

              That humans have created laws that place their rights above those of animals does not mean it is the correct ethical decision, it only shows that humans are interested in looking out for themselves.

            Humans are responsible [608] for damage caused by or danger done to 'their' animals, like cattle. This legal obligation results out of humans' property rights over these animals.

            1.5.2.12.3.2.3. Pro:
            Nonhuman animals are the personal property of their owners, even if recognized as a special kind of property. As such, they cannot themselves possess legal rights, because they are the objects of the exercise [609] of someone else's rights.

            1.5.2.12.3.2.4. Pro:
            Animals are legally classified [610] as 'goods' rather than having 'personality'.

            The property rights of slaveowners to their slaves should not interfere with the rights of the slaves. Similarly, the property rights of owners of animals should not interfere with the rights of the animals.

          1.5.2.12.3.3. Pro:
          Humans currently give different consideration to animals such as pets (whom we care for) and farm animals (whom we eat). This is an arbitrary line to draw, as both have the same right to live.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.1. Pro:
            We place undue importance on animals who are viewed as pets. [611] If a pig was kept as a pet, one could be reported for animal cruelty for purposefully hurting it. However, pigs who are kept on farms for the purpose of providing meat are able to be treated very cruelly, showing the arbitrariness.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.2. Pro:
            There is significant evidence thatpigs are as smart and sociable as dogs [612], but because people enjoy eating their meat we choose to treat them as farm animals instead of potential pets.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.3. Con:
            Giving different considerations to animals such as is it socially acceptable to eat it or not does not mean animals do or should have a right to life, natural or legal.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.4. Con:
            The line that seems to be drawn is not by everyone, people have been eating meat ever since the very beginning and from all livestock possible. This idea for some is hard to access but yes people do also eat animals you keep as pets.

              1.5.2.12.3.3.4.1. Pro:
              The line that is traced is different according to the different cultural contexts. But still, the claim is that the way that line is traced is arbitrary, whether the context you choose to analyse.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.5. Pro:
            If you respect your dog and understand their innate understanding/ caring, bonds, etc, surely you can understand all animals have these qualities.

            1.5.2.12.3.3.6. Con:
            The differentiation is not arbitrary but based on a history of social and emotional relationships which humans have with animals they generally do not eat, such as dogs and horses, but not with those they generally eat, such as cows and pigs.

          1.5.2.12.3.5. Con:
          The limited sentience of most animal species means that they can be used to fulfill human desires, such as through farming, as long as it is not unnecessarily cruel.

            1.5.2.12.3.5.1. Con:
            All animals display the instinct to self-preservation, that is, the instinct to avoid pain or damage to their bodies.

            1.5.2.12.3.5.2. Con:
            We are not sure of this "limited sentience" and, in fact, the further into animal intelligence we dive, the more evidence we find that intelligence and self-awareness are far more widespread than we once thought. Some of the animals we consume as food are, in fact, quite intelligent - capable of problem solving, complex social relationships, even communicating in ways that border on language.

          1.5.2.12.3.7. Con:
          Animals do not have "rights" at all. They live in a state of eat or be eaten. Rights do not exist in the natural world at all, only in the socially constructed world that humans have created for themselves.

            1.5.2.12.3.7.1. Pro:
            Fairness, being a construct of the human mind, is the concept which allows the intuition of rights. Animals cannot have rights, if their behavior does not acknowledge this assumed virtue, but rather could only be benefactors of human charity. Human charity would bestow, upon animals, privileges as opposed to rights.

            1.5.2.12.3.7.2. Con:
            Even if society did not exist and humans lived in a state of anarchy, it would still be immoral to murder or torture people. This indicates that rights exist independently of social construction.

              1.5.2.12.3.7.2.1. Con:
              While morality exists independently of social construction (i.e. moral relativism is not logical), it does not exist outside of human perspective, or at least not in the same way. Perspectivalism shows us that all of our facts about morality (eg. murder is wrong) comes exclusively from a human perspective. For instance, our closest cousins, Chimps, may injure or murder their own species in dominance disputes which results in the winner getting a chance to mate (reward, not punishment).

            1.5.2.12.3.7.3. Con:
            This claim makes multiple statements. "Rights do not exist in the natural world" is true. However, "animals do not have rights at all" is false. They have rights when we grant rights to them.

              1.5.2.12.3.7.3.1. Pro:
              There are many laws and moral codes which provide for the rights of animals.

          1.5.2.12.3.8. Con:
          "Human rights" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. They are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. We can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. We cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  A wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.

            1.5.2.12.3.8.1. Con:
            This argument suggests that humans only have a right to life because a human society claims such. In other words, the right to life — for anything, is not an intrinsic value. Therefore, outside the confines of a society which grants (which allows) the right to life, humans do not have a right to life.

              1.5.2.12.3.8.1.1. Pro:
              Suggesting that humans have this right to life regardless of one's current capacity to reason is due to humans' "intrinsic potential for reason" is not sufficient enough to justify our behavior in the way we separate ourselves from non-human animals. Dolphins, elephants, chimps, and many other non-human animals have continually demonstrated their capacity to reason (and compassion toward other species) and yet we don't grant them the right to life.

            1.5.2.12.3.8.2. Con:
            Stating that one's capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions is not sufficient reason to argue that non-human animals should not also have a right to life. Babies and the elderly who've lost their capacity for reason are two examples of humans who do not have the capacity to understand, communicate with others, and hold others accountable for their actions. Yet, our society grants them the right to life.

              1.5.2.12.3.8.2.1. Con:
              Babies have the opportunity for free will and grown up human concioussness in the future. The animals do not.

                1.5.2.12.3.8.2.1.1. Con:
                Without evidence, it could just as easily be stated that humans also lack free will, leaving all factors equal on this standpoint.

            1.5.2.12.3.8.3. Con:
            Rights can be enforced on both humans and nonhuman animals, such as by imprisoning a murderer (or predator) that would infringe on others' right to life and safety.

            1.5.2.12.3.8.4. Con:
            We only experience human consciousness, but we don't know for sure whether animals are conscious or not. We do have some evidence suggesting that animals do have social systems which govern acceptable behaviour, communicate with each other, and hold each other accountable. We cannot discount their perspectives and values simply because we aren't able to understand them.

          1.5.2.12.3.9. Con:
          Even if animals did live free of human slaughter, they would most likely die due to consumption by predators anyways so you might as well use the animals in a way that benefits humans.

            1.5.2.12.3.9.1. Con:
            The way an animal lives is at least as important as how it dies, and farm animals have demonstrably lower quality of life than wild animals in at least some cases (over-crowded cages/enclosures, absence of freedom of movement, inability to escape rivals, etc.).

            1.5.2.12.3.9.2. Con:
            The argument that you should do something to your own benefit because the same thing would happen if you didn't so you might as well is immoral. For example, I might as well rape that passed out girl because it's going to happen to her anyway so I might as well get to do it is an immoral way to approach something.

          1.5.2.12.3.10. Con:
          It would be good to eradicate certain Mosquitos and parasites, so they cannot have such a right.

            1.5.2.12.3.10.1. Con:
            This is already a debateable point, but even if we assume it's true, then it would be good to eradicate them because they do more harm (and cost more lives) than their own life's worth, NOT because their life has NO value of its own.

          1.5.2.12.3.11. Con:
          A chicken or cow doesn't have any frame of reference, and hence doesn't know what a good or bad life is. We like to attribute meaning to our own lifes and subsequently, animals lives too. If a chicken does not know what it is like to live in the wilderness then is it suffering inside?

            1.5.2.12.3.11.1. Con:
            If this argument was true, it would be moral for someone to be raised their whole life in something akin to a prison, as long as it was all they were exposed to, as they would not know there is a better life, but this is clearly false.

            1.5.2.12.3.11.2. Con:
            Cows and chickens know what it is like to feel pain, and desire not to feel pain. This is sufficient to give them a right to live free of suffering.

            1.5.2.12.3.11.3. Con:
            It doesn't matter what the chicken's frame of reference is, as long as the chicken is suffering under our treatment. In the words of the Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham [613], "the question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"

          1.5.2.12.3.12. Pro:
          It is our moral duty to minimize the suffering we cause to conscious beings. To the degree to which a being has the capacity to suffer, we have a responsibility to minimize the suffering we cause it.

          1.5.2.12.3.13. Pro:
          Imagine we could harvest meat from a meat plant. If you believe it is more ethical to harvest meat from a plant than from an animal, then you recognize that harvesting meat from animals is unethical.

            1.5.2.12.3.13.1. Con:
            It is more ethical to give to charity than to not give to charity, but to not give to charity is not immoral.

              1.5.2.12.3.13.1.1. Con:
              Not donating to charity does not harm anyone, whereas eating meat does harm. Not giving to charity is a morally neutral action. Eating meat is a morally negative action.

              1.5.2.12.3.13.1.2. Con:
              Some forms of moral reasoning do in fact consider inaction immoral.

            1.5.2.12.3.13.2. Con:
            There are other reasons why harvesting meat from a meat plant is more desirable. It is a more efficient process to grow a plant than to raise an animal. Therefore from a carbon standpoint the plant is more ethical.

          1.5.2.12.3.14. Pro:
          Because animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics [614], which advocates maximising pleasure and minimising suffering for all sentient beings.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.1. Con:
            The pleasure of a human is worth more than the life of an animal because it is scarcer. Thus, utilitarian ethics suggest that humans should keep eating meat.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.1.1. Pro:
              From a human perspective it is easy to produce more animals but difficult to create pleasure. Comparing the two, this makes pleasure more valuable to humans than animal lives.

                    1.5.2.12.3.14.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    Many experiences can non-fatally involve animals, and yet produce pleasure e.g. petting a pet.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.1.1.2. Con:
                There are many other ways for humans to get joy that do not require the suffering of animals e.g. spending time with loved ones, participating in hobbies and sports, and eating other food they enjoy that does not include animal products. This means joy is not a good reason for eating meat.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2. Con:
              Billions of animals are brutalized and tortured on factory farms every year. Since the only pleasure humans get from eating meat is gustatory pleasure, it is doubtful that the pain and suffering that these animals experience can ever be justified according to utilitarian principles.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.1. Con:
                There is way more [615] animal suffering going on in the wild than on human-made farms. Effective utilitarianism would thus have to start at considerations about how to ease the lot of wild animals.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  Domestic vertebrates comprise a majority of the vertebrate biomass on Earth; humans and domestic vertebrates together comprise an overwhelming majority (>95%). Humans therefore control a majority of vertebrate suffering.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.1.2. Con:
                  It is sensible and more feasible to start taking action in areas that we are directly involved with and responsible for. Unlike the suffering of farm animals, the suffering [616] of wild animals is in large part not related to human actions, but to natural predators, diseases, harsh natural habitats, naturally short life-spans, more offspring than can be fed, etc.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.2. Con:
                There is much more impotance to mild and moderate rates of meat comsumption than just gustatory pleasures, and, evolutionarily, such benefits [617] of less energy dispensed at feeding and more calory rich diets were important to the development of human brain size, which, in turn, originated many of our current pleasures.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.2.1. Con:
                  The fact that meat was historically important for our development does not imply that we should continue eating it now.

                    1.5.2.12.3.14.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                    The fact that meat was the most efficient route for the development of civilization and human biology (as we do not have the proper enzymes to digest cellulose [618]) does indeed suggest it is best to keep eating meat in mild or moderate quantities. Not necessarily as much as we ingest right now, but it certainly is not wrong.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.1.3. Con:
              Human pleasure evaporates quickly while an animal life is lost forever. These after effects make an animal life worth more.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.1.4. Con:
              It is not necessarily true that human pleasure is scarce. People find many ways to experience pleasure, through spending time with loved ones, participating in hobbies and watching media entertainment. There are likely also other foods humans can eat to experience pleasure without relying on meat.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.1.4.1. Pro:
                The food most commonly, directly, and immediately associated with pleasure in mainstream society is chocolate - a processed plant food.

            Act utilitarian Peter Singer [619] argues that the Basic Principle of Equality should be extended to nonhuman animals and that it would demand us to equally consider the interests of animals.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.3.1. Con:
              Singer bases his argument on the presence of interests. If a being has interests, these have to be taken into account. Yet this would make eating plants as immoral as eating animals as they obviously have interests, for example in survival and reproduction. Singer's argument therefore suffers from arbitrary delineations [620].

            Utilitarian ethics is not only a disputed way of thinking, but is very difficult to implement (for instance, what is the appropriate time span of pain/pleasure that we are computing?), especially in nature, which does not care about utilitarianism.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.5. Con:
            We are beginning to find evidence that plants feel as well. [621] If plants and animals both feel, we cannot afford to treat them both with utilitarian ethics, we have to eat something! Animals are not more deserving of care than plants. No matter what we do, we'll be making an ethical compromise and killing a living, feeling being.

              We have to make a choice. Because we must eat organically, we must eat plants. However, for plants, being consumed is part of their reproductive cycle. For example, they bear fruit which is mean to be consumed, thereby scattering their seeds.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.6. Con:

            Farm animals feel [623] pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are sentient [624] and intelligent beings, thus utilitarianism can be applied to them. (psychologytoday.com [625])

              Animals' sentience is instantaneous [627] and ephemeral, they are not capable of long term predictions, therefore not suffering in anticipation to existential angst in events such as death.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.7.3.1. Con:
                They are, however, capable of suffering from being restrained, poor living conditions, over-crowding, injury and illness, mutilation without anaesthesia, etc.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.8. Con:
            A pleasure maximizing ethical paradigm might just as easily justify breeding livestock for food, raising them in a way that maximizes their happiness, and killing them in the most humane manner possible. By bringing a life into this world you are increasing total happiness and satisfying the tastes/preferences of humans who desire meat as food.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.9. Con:
            Humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner. Animals are not, thus they are unequal to humans on a moral level.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.9.1. Con:
              Plenty of researchers would disagree and argue that moral and ethical behavior can be observed in animals, for example Frans de Waal [628] as well as Marc Bekoff and Jessice Pierce [629].

                1.5.2.12.3.14.9.1.1. Pro:
                Frans de Waal [630] is an expert in both zoology and ethology. This makes him an ideal candidate to judge the ethical behavior observed in animals.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.9.1.2. Pro:
                Dominique Lestel wrote a book called Les Origines Animales de la Culture, parting from Uexküll phenomenological reviews, that claims that other animals have different ways of life, cultures, and even aesthetical senses.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.9.2. Con:
              Some humans are not capable of culture, innovation, or sublimation of instinct, and are thus not able to act in an ethical manner (i.e cognitive disability), but we still consider their interests morally relevant.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.9.2.1. Con:
                The reason for that is that these people are our own kind.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.9.3. Con:
              For any supposed capacity that humans possess and animals lack, and in virtue of which humans but not animals are taken to have rights, some humans will lack that capacity and some animals may possess that capacity. For instance, humans generally have the ability to reason, while most animals lack this capacity. But this cannot be the basis on which humans have and animals lack rights, because certain humans, including young infants, lack the ability to reason and certain animals may have it.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.9.4. Con:
              This does not excuse cruelty or unnecessary harm.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.9.5. Con:
              Animals are able to suppress their instincts, something that, for example, dog training aims at.

            1.5.2.12.3.14.10. Con:
            The argument has been made that plants are equally sentient and intelligent [631], even though not in the same sense as humans and animals are. By the same logic, utilitarian ethics would forbid the killing of plants.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1. Con:
              Eating crops is necessary for many people to survive. Eating meat is not. Thus, there is a difference in the logic applied.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.1. Con:
                It is possible to only eat meat for one year. As a study from 1930 illustrates 'nothing much [632]' happens.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.2. Con:
                Inuit [633] ate mainly meat and hardly any plants and survived.

                Crops provide us with important minerals [635] that are essential for a variety of bodily functions.

                  By eating meat, people can satisfy their mineral [636] demand as well.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.4. Pro:
                Dietary fibre [637] is present in all plant foods – fruits, vegetables and grains – but not in animal foods. Without fibre we cannot survive and therefore need to eat plants.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.4.1. Pro:
                  Fibre smooths out digestion and absorption of glucose and fats in the small intestine.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.4.2. Pro:
                  Fibre provides fuel for the healthful or “good” bacteria in our large intestine which in turn benefit us by making vitamin B12, and by releasing volatile fatty acids from the dietary fibre which are important for the health of our colon.

                  1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.4.3. Pro:
                  Fibre speeds up transit though the intestines to remove waste and toxins from our body.

                1.5.2.12.3.14.10.1.5. Pro:
                Plants and crops are often the cheapest food that people can buy to sustain themselves, and if people lack resources this may mean it is very necessary for their survival.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.10.2. Con:
              As noted in the linked article, plants are able to survive losing a large portion of their biomass - and many produce fruiting bodies deliberately intended for consumption by animals - whereas harvesting an animal for meat kills it 100% of the time. It is more possible to ethically harvest (some) plants than animals.

              1.5.2.12.3.14.10.3. Con:
              Farming animals for meat requires either farming plants for their food, or allowing them to graze in deliberately altered semi-natural environments. Therefore, farming meat produces a greater utilitarian loss than farming plants, as farming plants only harms and kills plants directly, while farming meat harms and kills both plants and the animals.

          1.5.2.12.3.15. Con:
          This statement is illogically selective. Why it should apply to just animals versus all living things? Why do all plants or microbes not have a right to live and be free of suffering?

            1.5.2.12.3.15.1. Con:
            There is less clear and abundant evidence that plants and microorganisms suffer in ways analogous to humans and other animals.

          1.5.2.12.3.16. Con:
          Animals bred for meat would not exist if their meat was not to be consumed. Wherein does their right to life reside if nobody is willing to create the circumstances of their existence?

            1.5.2.12.3.16.1. Pro:
            Where would the animals go? If we stop farming animals for food, there will be numerous domesticated species that are no longer needed in farming but may also struggle to exist in the wild. If we could not agree space for them and invest in managing their transition to a stable wild ecosystem (the path for which is uncertain and could take generations), then the only alternative would be mass culling and ultimately the extinction of these species.

            1.5.2.12.3.16.2. Pro:
            Countless animals have experienced life because they were bred as food. For me the better question is whether they are living a life worth living. Do they have room to roam, do they live without undue suffering, are they treated with respect while they are alive.

          -> See 1.3.9.3.1.

          1.5.2.12.3.18. Pro:
          Meat comes from a living source that only dies in order for us to sustain our own living. We say it is morally incorrect to kill another human being but for an animal it is okay? This belief is hypocritical in nature.

            1.5.2.12.3.18.1. Con:
            It is morally permissible to kill or cause the death of another human to save your own life in some situations.

            1.5.2.12.3.18.2. Con:
            Sentence "killing humans is wrong" doesn't imply sentence "killing animals is wrong". Hence one person can simultaneously assert that killing humans is wrong, and that killing animals is okay, avoiding any contradiction or hypocrisy.

              1.5.2.12.3.18.2.1. Pro:
              The word "animal" has wider range than word "human". Although every human is an animal, not every animal is a human. Statements concerning more narrow terms do not necessarily apply to wider terms.

          1.5.2.12.3.19. Pro:
          Animals are sentient beings - they feel pain and have complex emotional lives. Many have family structures and are able to bond. Killing them for our pleasure when alternatives exist is immoral and archaic.

          1.5.2.12.3.20. Con:
          Without the raising of animals for slaughter, they wouldn't have had a life in the first place. They are fed and raised to maturity.

            1.5.2.12.3.20.1. Con:
            They also wouldn't have been forced to suffer as they often are in modern factory farming.

          1.5.2.12.3.21. Pro:
          Animals feel pain. And if you suggest that they are inferior therefore you have the right to do anything to them, you should also have the right to do anything you want with mentally challenged people or any other human who is inferior to you. Society is better than in the past exactly because of empathy from which morality arises. It is time to get past our arrogance towards other animals.

            1.5.2.12.3.21.1. Con:
            Suggesting one human is (inherently) inferior to another is highly subjective and potentially problematic.

          1.5.2.12.3.22. Pro:
          Ethics persuade us that we have a duty not to exploit anyone, and beyond that, a duty to actively help all victims of exploitation from their plight to the best of our ability. Animals in this case are innocent victims of mass exploitation.

            1.5.2.12.3.22.1. Con:
            Animals are not innocent in the sense that they have no conflict of conscience over consuming their prey.

            1.5.2.12.3.22.2. Con:
            A "duty to help" would need to include exploitation of nature as well as mankind. Nature's treatment of animals is as bad or worse than that of humans.

          1.5.2.12.3.23. Pro:
          70 billion animals are sacrificed every year for consumption [638].

          1.5.2.12.3.24. Con:
          Animals are not morally equivalent to humans and therefore do not possess an equal natural right to live.

            1.5.2.12.3.24.1. Pro:
            Animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1. Con:
              By this logic babies, little children as well as severely mentally disabled people cannot be possessors of rights either. But that would be wrong.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.1. Con:
                Infants and disabled humans are participants in the human moral community, and so they possess rights.

                  1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                  Infants and disabled people are usually valued by family members or caretakers.

                  1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                  Infants and severely mentally disabled people are part of our species, and deserve respect on that basis.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.2. Con:
                Animals do not have the potential of ever being part of the human community, whereas the mentally disabled and little children do.

                  There are many cases of disability where there is no possibility of becoming morally independent and part of our 'moral community'

                  1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.2.3. Con:
                  This is a tautology as animals cannot be part of the human community because the human community only consists of humans.

                  1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.2.4. Pro:
                  It is selective morality to assign some species as a food source, and others as pets.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.3. Pro:
                If conceptualisation of morality was a precondition to 'exist within our moral community' and to have the right to live and not be tortured and slaughtered, it would become permissible to harm pets, members of different moral communities (different cultures), people in a coma, with dementia and many others

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.4. Pro:
                Sentience is not moral justification for enslaving other beings across species-lines, any more than it is moral justification for enslaving ones own species who biologically lack cognitive abilities due to medical disorder. What about the taxonomy of a being permits otherwise morally egregious behavior?

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.5. Con:
                Babies, little children, and the mentally disabled do have substantially fewer rights than healthy adults. At the extreme end, a fetus can be aborted and people with extreme brain damage can be taken off life-support without their consent. Similarly, the animals should be provided a limited set of rights (which they are, though I'll admit it should be expanded) but I don't see anything substantially worse about a cow being slaughtered at a young age than dying of a disease at old age.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.1.2. Pro:
              Humans in a society gain rights by the virtue of duties they have. Animals are unable to fulfill duties and therefore cannot enjoy the rights attached to them.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.2.1. Con:
                Animals are responsible for important social tasks as well, e.g. guide dogs or therapy [639] animals. Humans depend on animals with this functions.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.2.2. Con:
                Human rights are not granted to humans based on any duties but, as the name implies, simply because they are human.

                In 2015, the New Zealand Parliament unanimously passed the Animal Welfare Amendment Act [640] (No. 2) 2015, which includes an amendment to the long title of the principal legislation, the Animal Welfare Act 1999, in order to specifically recognize animals as sentient.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.3.2. Pro:
                In 1999, Public Law 106-152 [641] (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action in the US. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them.

              The social contract is a theoretic construct anyway, since no person literally entered it by signing anything.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.4.1. Pro:
                Since contracts require consent to be legitimate, and no one has meaningfully consented to the social contract, the social contract has no force as a theory of morality.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.4.2. Con:
                Even if the social construct is purely theoretic, it is a good way of deliberating about moral demands and duties.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.1.5. Pro:
              Moral duties do not exist intrinsically. They are constructed and bestowed upon us through our participation in society.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.1.6. Con:
              Animal Rights Theory claims, in its most part, negative rights for animals, i.e.: the right not to suffer, not to die, not to (...). Some non-paradigmatic humans may have no positive rights, but they still have their negative rights guaranteed.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.1.6.1. Con:
                Negative rights for humans arise from an agreement not to violate the negative rights of others. Animals are not capable of entering into such an agreement.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.2.3. Con:
              "Reason" cannot be a parameter for moral judgement, because it gives us nothing about the moral status of a subject. Using "reason" as criteria for moral status is like using the capacity of breathing underwater or flying with  your own wings for the same ends.

              The claim that the life of every human is equally worthwhile, judged intrinsically [653], cannot be construed as a basis for saying that each and every human being has an equal right to life. For the two claims would mean the same thing.

              Animals also have positive interests [655] and it does not matter that they are of comparatively low grade, because the same is true of some human beings who may be largely restricted to food and beverages.

                Both humans and animals display both reflex and planned actions.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.6.4.3. Con:
                Animals could not form meaningful bonds with each other (or with humans) if every action was impulsive and reactive.

                  1.5.2.12.3.24.6.4.3.1. Pro:
                  Animals will often pine for owners or companions when they are not present, injured, or deceased.

                1.5.2.12.3.24.6.4.4. Con:
                Human behaviour could also be argued to be deterministic, thus leaving all factors equal on this standpoint.

              1.5.2.12.3.24.6.5. Con:
              Animals can't be inferior to something they don't have. Only human beings are able to hypothesize their presence in time and space, hence acting freely and have a morality.

            1.5.2.12.3.24.8. Con:
            Animals are a naturally occurring lifeform just as much as humans are.

          1.5.2.12.3.25. Con:
          The type of intensive agriculture required to produce vegetarian food on a scale to feed current populations inherently causes the death of animals. To plant acres of soy one must displace every single animal living there, eradicate every bird, mouse, squirrel that would eat the crop, poison every insect, grind up every creature in the path of the harvester, etc. Farming is an ecological disaster that represents death to every living being that is not the crop.

      1.5.2.13. Con:
      In many, if not most, places it is much more difficult or expensive [657] for consumers to purchase truly 'ethical' meat rather than to simply opt for a vegetarian option.

        1.5.2.13.1. Con:
        In those cases, consumers could have a moral obligation to either purchase the expensive ethical meat or not purchase meat at all. This still would not imply that we should never eat meat.

        1.5.2.13.2. Pro:
        Nearly every piece of meat comes from factory farms with unethical conditions – the meat in the supermarket, in restaurants, public events et cetera. Choosing to abstain from this kind of meat means practically to completely abstain from meat as there is in fact no supply for it.

        1.5.2.13.3. Pro:
        Ethical meat consumption is not a widespread effective method of reducing animal harm. Not eating meat is simple, consumes little to no time, and has been proven to work for a massive amount of human beings.

      1.5.2.14. Con:
      While is possible that ethical farms exist, there are no ethical slaughter houses. They are all horrifying death factories that expose animals to unimaginable stress and have terrible effect on human workers.

        1.5.2.14.1. Con:
        Humans have always find nutrients around them. Killing an animal of another species has not the same ethical value as killing a human. There will be much more stress in going personally to hunt animals.

      1.5.2.15. Con:
      Nothing in the world had to be cruel, it just is. Facing the situation where animals are being constantly tortured in the name of bigger profits and simply advocate for a moral shift is an over simplification. Defend an ethical way to produce meat is a nice thing but not practical

      1.5.2.16. Con:
      Choosing to eat meat ethically is a luxury that many can't afford. Ethically produced meat is generally expensive and cheaper meat is generally amongst the least ethically produced.

        1.5.2.16.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.14.1.

        1.5.2.16.2. Con:
        This doesn't mean you shouldn't eat meat from those sources if you have access to them.

      1.5.2.17. Con:
      It is impossible to upscale 'ethically sourced' meat production to meet the huge demand for meat, in order to not change current meat consumption habits. 'Better consumer choice' is therefore impossible on a global scale.

      1.5.2.18. Pro:
      All animals are not the same in their ability to grow meat while suffering. Good animal welfare (and meat quality) is highly correlated with high meat production rates in beef for example. There is a profit incentive to increasing animal welfare outcomes in this case. Therefore if consumers chose to eat meats of this type there would be financial incentives for the big meat producers to maximise animal welfare.

        1.5.2.18.1. Con:
        Even if better welfare improves meat quality, most animals are still treated poorly, indicating that reducing costs is a better strategy for profits than increasing quality. This is probably because consumers are more sensitive to price than quality. There's no reason to expect this to significantly change any time soon.

      1.5.2.19. Pro:
      Animals can be raised in ways that cause little-no suffering, such as organically where they are free to roam outside and not fed things like growth hormones.

      1.5.2.20. Con:
      Despite attempts to advocate for better farming, farms are becoming more industrialised over time. See for example the graph Annual Pig Crop Distribution by Size of Operation – United States: 1994-2014 [658]. There is no evidence that consumers can realistically reverse this trend.

    1.5.3. Con:
    Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.

      1.5.3.1. Pro:
      Millions of animals are killed [659] every year to allow for appropriate land to grow crops such as wheat and barley.

        1.5.3.1.1. Con:
        The unintentional deaths of animals such as mice during the production of harvesting crops is very different to intentionally breeding animals such as cows for slaughter.

          1.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
          If we are considering animals as living beings worthy of rights, they are still relevant.

      1.5.3.2. Con:
      A study [660] done on how many animals die to produce 1,000,000 calories of a number of different food sources found that for vegetables it is only 2.55 animals, while for beef it is 29 animals and for chicken it is 251.1. This suggests significantly fewer animals are harmed in the production of vegetarian products.

        1.5.3.2.1. Pro:
        In many cases, even farming basic grains kills 25 times more sentient animals [661] (as measured against per kg of usable protein in the final product) than the equivalent farming practices for red meat.

          1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro:
          Ploughing and harvesting kill small mammals, snakes, lizards and other animals in vast numbers.

            1.5.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Small animals have far less sophisticated consciousness than most farm animals, so it is less morally wrong to kill them.

              1.5.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
              This logic leads then to the proposal that we eat more chicken and less beef, or that we eat more mice instead of chicken or beef. But there is no way to calculate the level of consciousness of a chicken compared to a cow and then multiply that by the number of chickens needed to replace the meat in one cow.

              1.5.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
              This is not certain. Elephants are far larger than humans, but also widely acknowledged to be less intelligent, even if more intelligent than "average" animals. Without first-hand insight into the thoughts and consciousness of any given animal, all we have is guesswork from observed behaviour.

                1.5.3.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                Rats display a broad variety of interesting and sophisticated behaviour. [662]

          1.5.3.2.1.2. Pro:
          Millions [663] of mice are poisoned in grain storage facilities every year and millions more are killed during 'mice plagues' that often affect crop areas.

            1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Con:
            -> See 1.5.3.2.1.1.1.

            1.5.3.2.1.2.2. Con:
            Meat production requires large amounts of grains to feed the animals that comprise it, this means that a large portion of these small animal deaths is a side effect of cultivation that only exists due to the breeding of animals for meat production

            1.5.3.2.1.2.3. Con:
            Poisoning and killing mice may not be the only way to prevent them from interfering with grain production - natural barriers and repellents may be implementable, for instance.

            1.5.3.2.1.2.4. Con:
            Poisoning pest animals is on its own an ethically questionable farming method (due to both the deaths of animals and potential health effects on humans), and one which ethical and organic farms may choose not use.

          1.5.3.2.1.3. Pro:
          Red meat animals feed on pasture, which requires next to no upkeep. In contrast, farming vegetables requires the use of pesticides that kill massive amounts of insects and/or similar measures that kill birds.

            1.5.3.2.1.3.1. Con:
            99% of red meat animals in the United States spend at least some portion of their lives in a feedlot.  The grains in the feedlots have at least the same likelihood of requiring the use of pesticides, killing insects/birds, etc.

            1.5.3.2.1.3.2. Con:
            Most red meat production is not free grazing.

            1.5.3.2.1.3.3. Con:
            Dismissing the most destructive example of vegetable farming by citing the least destructive animal feeding practice does not dismiss the best vegetable farming practices (hydroponics, intensive indoor growing, etc).

            1.5.3.2.1.3.4. Con:
            Farming animals that provide red meat, such as cows contributes to large amounts of deforestation.

          1.5.3.2.1.4. Con:
          Measuring against kg of usable protein is misleading, since meat has higher concentrations of proteins relative to other nutrients. So the gap between meat and grains is not that large.

            1.5.3.2.1.4.1. Con:
            I think the opposite is true - because meat has higher protein density, relatively more e.g. grains used for human consumption is needed (in this context for covering dietary protein needs), and so the alleged loss of animal life is relatively larger, if one accepts the premise (that livestock consume more on pasture than harvested crops in feedlots)

          1.5.3.2.1.5. Con:
          99% of animals raised for red meat spend at least some of their lives on feedlots. The grains they are fed are just as responsible for killing sentient animals.

            1.5.3.2.1.5.1. Con:
            The article refers to Australia where that is not the case due to the vast amount of grazing space for cattle.

            1.5.3.2.1.5.2. Con:
            The percentage is exagerated, and the origin of the animal protein will determine that, since in some productions such as cattle in most South America or Australia (example of the article) the same pasture stays in the soil for over ten years, something that only happens in vegetable production if it is utilized a permaculture system.

          1.5.3.2.1.6. Con:
          That article only refers to Australia where cattle spend significantly more time grazing in fields. That does not hold for animals in factory farms fed a diet from farmed plant products.

          1.5.3.2.1.7. Con:
          The article linked to is full of misinformation. Check the comments section for refutation of nearly every point. One point is the many mice being killed by harvest of grains, yet  "the only fields a mouse might be attracted to would be wheat or corn. Since both of those are harvested by machines which cut the stalks several inches above the ground. Any self respecting mouse would have no problem avoiding the harvester unless it is suicidal."

            1.5.3.2.1.7.1. Con:
            The article does not talk about deaths of mice from harvesters, it talks of deaths of mice from pesticides to protect the crop.

          1.5.3.2.1.8. Con:
          Modern urban farming using techniques such as hydroponics [664], aquaponics, and microfarming does not directly or indirectly harm animals, and yields far greater crop yields than traditional farming techniques.

            1.5.3.2.1.8.1. Con:
            These more modern techniques frequently require much more energy than their traditional alternatives [665]. This indirectly harms animals and humans.

            1.5.3.2.1.8.2. Pro:
            These novel farming methods provide more land for wildlife to roam, live, survive, and thrive by using less land to grow food on.

            1.5.3.2.1.8.3. Pro:
            These methods tend to be in vertical gardens, which greatly reduce the conflicts between wildlife and farmers (which often lead to predators, such as wolves, being shot).

          1.5.3.2.1.9. Con:
          This depends on the food. Hand-picked crops like strawberries and peas do not harm as many animals — if anything they support life because beneficial insects are brought to the farm to help the crops grow. Some foods like rice are used as habitats for birds [666].

            1.5.3.2.1.9.1. Con:
            The world's massive food-intake requirements cannot be met by a small subset of hand-picked crops.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.1. Con:
              Is there evidence that this is true? We could ramp up production if people switch over from meat.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.2. Pro:
              Hand-picked crops are more expensive and time-consuming

                1.5.3.2.1.9.1.2.1. Pro:
                These factors might lead more crops to be produced in foreign countries where labor is cheaper but so are the standards. The product might have more chemicals in them that are not safe.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.3. Con:
              Hand-picked crops could be supplemented with other crops to be viable to a world population

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.4. Con:
              The world already has difficulties providing food-intake requirements with non-hand-picked crops. Eating only hand-picked crops will be the solution instead of a barrier.

                1.5.3.2.1.9.1.4.1. Pro:
                Food travels many miles ("food miles") to reach a destination. This raises food prices where some people cannot afford it. If everyone immediately eats food they picked (such as if they grow their own), then the food miles go to 0, thus making it much cheaper.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.5. Pro:
              Hand-picked crops are dangerous for workers [667], making it not viable.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.6. Con:
              Automation could possibly improve over time where it becomes as humane as hand-picking. Then more options will open up.

              1.5.3.2.1.9.1.7. Pro:
              With the laws that encourage food waste right now (such as USDA grades [668]), hand-picked crops do not seem a viable option.

                1.5.3.2.1.9.1.7.1. Con:
                If laws and people change their habits where they eat food that does not meet standards (such as "ugly produce [669]"), then less food is wasted and hand-picking will be a more viable option.

            1.5.3.2.1.9.2. Pro:
            Hydroponic and aeroponic crops that are hand-picked on the spot are both more humane (indoor farming tends to have less animal issues) and less resource-intensive (more land for wildlife instead of agriculture and less driving = less roadkill)

          1.5.3.2.1.10. Con:
          This claim and the supporting article are very specific to beef cattle reared in Australia where pastoral lands are abundant. It doesn't hold when you consider the land required for free range animal rearing to satisfy the global appetite for meat.

        1.5.3.2.2. Con:
        That study relies on a 'best case' farming practice that seeks to minimise animal deaths and protect crops through all stages of vegetable production. In almost all cases those practices are not followed in mainstream agriculture.

        1.5.3.2.3. Con:
        That study included, "animals slaughtered directly for food, and animals killed in the harvesting of crops... predators killed in defense of livestock, animals prevented from existing by the destruction of their habitat, and human deaths from food poisoning, disease, or accidents on farms or in slaughterhouses."
        
        It does not include intentionally killed pest animals, which would likely make a difference for both sources, especially if they included insects, which they did not.

        1.5.3.2.4. Con:
        While the study suggests fewer animals are harmed in production of vegetarian products, the authors themselves recognize limitations in their own study. They clearly state that no accurate estimates exist of how many animals are actually harmed due to farming practices.

          1.5.3.2.4.1. Con:
          There is no bounded study without limitations. It is better to have some indication than none.

        1.5.3.2.5. Con:
        The study talks about calories. Vegetables are more "calorie dense" (as in calories/kg) than meats. If we look at the numbers for protein production, the result would be the opposite, since meat is much more protein dense than vegetables. Calories alone are not sufficient for a healthy diet, and protein malnutrition can be fatal.

          1.5.3.2.5.1. Con:
          "Meat is much more protein dense than vegetables" is true only when comparing the average of all meats with the average of all vegetables. Some vegetable products like hemp seed and tempeh provide comparable amounts of complete proteins in comparable serving portions, while also providing other minerals and nutrients not typically found in meat. A vegan diet (+B vitamin) does not preclude adequate nutrition, nor does an omnivorous diet protect against malnutrition. healthyeating.sfgate.com [670]

          1.5.3.2.5.2. Con:
          The calorie is a more basic and important indicator of nutrition than protein content.

        1.5.3.2.6. Con:
        The study also does not take into account broader environmental impacts of plant agriculture like destruction of animal habitat for farmland, leaching of agricultural chemicals (even fertilizer leaked into nearby areas like water source can cause negative impacts like increased algae growth which can choke out fish species), and removal of insects which are often basal components of food webs of that area.

          1.5.3.2.6.1. Con:
          All of these are important issues, but these issues are made worse in the raising of animals for food.  This point ignores the amount of plant nutrition necessary in order to sustain livestock for human consumption; that amount is vastly more than if humans obtained their needed calories from plants directly. A large percent of calories and protein are lost in the conversion of plant-based animal feed into meat during the life of the animal that is being harvested.Feed-to-food conversions [671]

        1.5.3.2.7. Con:
        Animals per calorie is an absurd metric. 251.1 zooplankton are insignificant compared to 2.55 blue whales.

        1.5.3.2.8. Con:
        This is a severely misleading characterization of the study. A single cow provides far more than 1000 calories. A single pound of hamburger contains 1000 calories. www.myfitnesspal.com [672]

      1.5.3.3. Pro:
      Converting land to make it suitable for harvesting soybeans and other vegetable products results in habitat loss [673] that threatens entire ecosystems.

          1.5.3.3.1.1. Con:
          Vegans and vegetarians do not consume a significant amount more palm oil than meat-eaters

          1.5.3.3.1.2. Con:
          Plant oil is consumed by so many uses that it is independent to a choice between eating meat or the alternatives.

          1.5.3.3.1.3. Con:
          Conscientious avoidance of unsustainable palm oil sources is another issue.

          1.5.3.3.1.4. Con:
          These animal habitats are in danger due to lacking environmental protection and also from illegal activities.

        1.5.3.3.2. Con:

          There are many ways to raise animals for slaughter on the same land that is also used to grow plant-based foods, and some sustainable models suggest that cattle and other grazing creatures would be an essential part of a sustainable food system.

            1.5.3.3.2.3.1. Con:
            Growing the food for the animals that are raised for slaughter requires a large land area that cannot be used for food for humans. The land area [676] needed to grow plants to feed animals to feed humans is much larger than the land area needed to grow plants to feed humans.

            1.5.3.3.2.3.2. Con:
            Ungulates do play a role in regulating soil health, but farmers can do a much better job at this while producing more food.

              1.5.3.3.2.3.2.1. Pro:
              Ungulates do prevent the erosion of topsoil but the number of ungulates per unit area is not enough to provide a sustainable meat source.

        Land conversion occurs due to industrial activity and is not guided by an argument for meat or alternatives.

      1.5.3.4. Con:
      Since animals hurt by vegetarian farming are hurt as an unintended consequence, while producing meat necessarily involves killing animals, the former is moral and the latter is not.

        1.5.3.4.1. Pro:
        According to the Doctrine of Double Effect [677], if a harm is just an unintended consequence of a good action, then that good action can be morally permissible.

        1.5.3.4.2. Con:
        At the point those consequences are systemic to mainstream agricultural practices they can't really be held to be unintended; they are known and consistent consequences.

        1.5.3.4.3. Con:
        It doesn't matter if the consequence is intended or not, it still causes harm.

        1.5.3.4.4. Pro:
        There's an ethical difference between intentional killing and indirect killing.

        1.5.3.4.5. Con:
        Many of the animal deaths associated with vegetative farming are specifically intended, in order to protect crops and improve both yield and quality of harvest.

          1.5.3.4.5.1. Pro:
          Pesticides are frequently (and indiscriminately) sprayed over crops, many of which also harm humans directly or indirectly.

        1.5.3.4.6. Pro:
        The line of thought of deontologist philosophers supports this morality.

        1.5.3.4.7. Con:
        The teleologist philosophers line of thought supports that the later is immoral since is produces what is not intended.

        1.5.3.4.8. Con:
        In as much as the production of other crops does not intend to kill animals, the intent of producing meat is also not to kill animals. The fact that the animal has to die in order for us to eat it is just as much a side effect as the mouse that has to die for the grain to be harvested and stored.

          Suffering is very different from pain. [679] Farm animals don't generally suffer, and even creatures that don't experience pain can suffer.

            1.5.3.5.1.1.1. Pro:
            Pain is pain, and it’s bad enough. Suffering — which features distress and misery layered on top — occurs only when you try to fight that pain. src [680].

            1.5.3.5.1.1.2. Con:
            Pain implies suffering. The definition of pain [681] from the International Association for the Study of Pain is "An **unpleasant sensory and emotional experience** associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage." The above claim is likely misusing the word 'pain' to refer to nociception.

            1.5.3.5.1.1.3. Con:
            This article [682] summarises the scientific knowledge on birds feeling pain, and clearly implies that birds likely feel pain in a way that is similar to humans and implies suffering.

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.1. Pro:
              "It is generally accepted that birds perceive pain similarly to mammals. Birds have neurologic components to respond to painful stimuli"

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.2. Pro:
              "it is advisable to treat for pain when dealing with any condition expected to cause pain, especially if known to be painful in humans"

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.3. Pro:
              "Although it is unclear at this time at what taxonomic level nociception is associated with pain and whether all species, including humans, feel pain with the same qualities and intensities, operationally, vertebrates and some invertebrates feel pain."

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.4. Pro:
              "Unquestionably, the experience of pain must be aversive and unpleasant to motivate a bird or any other animal to change its behavior. In plain language, pain hurts regardless of the species."

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.5. Pro:
              "Pain is an individual sensory and emotional experience"

              1.5.3.5.1.1.3.6. Pro:
              "just because an animal (or a bird in the case of this review) may have a different pain experience from that of humans does not mean that the animal’s pain does not exist."

            1.5.3.5.1.1.4. Con:
            Chickens seek pain relief [683], suggesting that pain causes them to suffer: "Chickens also self-administer pain-killers. These birds often experience leg problems associated with breeding, growth and husbandry, and can develop highly abnormal gaits, or become completely unable to walk. Lame birds ingest more drugged food than non-lame birds, and as the severity of the lameness increases, lame birds consume a greater proportion of the drugged food"

        1.5.3.5.2. Pro:
        Deer, Elk, Antelope, rabbits, and wild pigs are just a few examples of larger mammals that wreak havoc on crops, and which are regularly killed to protect crops.

          1.5.3.5.2.1. Pro:
          In the UK, deer are responsible for £4.3m [684] worth of crop damage per year.

          1.5.3.5.2.2. Pro:
          Wild pigs are known to trample crops and devastate [685] orchards and vineyards.

          1.5.3.5.2.3. Con:
          Not on all the farms which is what the previous claim suggests. With many new forms of farming (example: en.wikipedia.org [686]) none of the animals which are larger than insects have to be hurt in the process.

            1.5.3.5.2.3.1. Con:
            Many of those "new forms of farming" are suitable for only a tiny fraction of crops, and if expanded broadly would wreak havoc on ecosystems.

          1.5.3.5.2.4. Con:
          True enough, but it doesn't seem to be in nearly the same magnitudes.

        1.5.3.5.3. Con:
        Pests can be repelled or physically barred rather than killed in many situations.

        1.5.3.5.4. Pro:
        There is no food source that does not involve the so-called cruel and immoral treatment of animals. All vegetable crops have natural predators, and these predators are harmed and killed in the process of producing these crops for human consumption.

          1.5.3.5.4.1. Con:
          True enough, but it doesn't seem to be in nearly the same magnitudes.

        1.5.3.5.5. Con:
        The number of large intelligent animals which need to be killed to maintain crops is far smaller than the number of such animals farmed directly.

      1.5.3.6. Con:
      Raising farm animals ultimately kills more plants than raising plant foods, due to the amount of feed required to raise the animals.

        1.5.3.6.1. Con:
        But you are operating under the assumption that you are correct that suffering and death is an unacceptable end, and therefore humans must not participate. If you are wrong, and we are arguing that you are, then the only thing that really matters is whether or not we raise plants and animals in an ethical environment where they will likely suffer less and die more peacefully than their wild cousins. If you are right, then all life is immoral and we must all die now to avoid further suffering.

          1.5.3.6.1.1. Con:
          Actually, the arguments suggest that we should minimize suffering as much as reasonably possible, not take unreasonable steps (such as exterminations) to eliminate it. Ceasing to eat meat may or may not be part of optimally reducing harm and suffering.

            1.5.3.6.1.1.1. Con:
            This claim has been addressed. [687]

              1.5.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con:
              And that claim is itself debated.

        1.5.3.6.2. Pro:
        Cows, as an example, will graze approximately 2% to 2.3% [688] of their own weight in grass each day.

      1.5.3.7. Con:
      Land must be cleared both for farming crops and rearing livestock, so the cumulative damage done by vegetarian farming is still lower.

      1.5.3.8. Pro:
      When we eat vegetables we are taking away food that animals could possibly eat. This could harm them in the long run.

        1.5.3.8.1. Con:
        Through innovative new farming technology, such as hydroponic vertical farming [689], food for animals can be produced in a very effective and sustainable manner.

        1.5.3.8.2. Con:
        Nature itself has a way of regulating wild life population. In the long run the population of for example cows will decrease, ensuring enough food.

        1.5.3.8.3. Con:
        Our produce is overwhelmingly grown in farms, not harvested, and thus not taken out of nature and away from animals. If you meant that any fruit that's eaten by a human was stolen from animals because it could have theoretically been gifted to an animal, than you'd have to consider eating anything stealing from every other animal on Earth, including humans.

        1.5.3.8.4. Con:
        Generally feeding animals farm-grown produce is thought to have harmful affects on both the animal and human populations of a region when we could allow nature to self-regulate its populations. Animal feeding could potentially be used to lessen the immediate impact of widespread deforestation on some species, but generally this would be drastically less efficient than choosing not to destroy their habitats in the first place and would only slow the local animal population's imminent demise.

      1.5.3.9. Con:
      Over time indirect animal deaths from farming could be reduced, if this was an explicit goal.

        1.5.3.9.1. Pro:
        Certain plant crops are easy to grow hydroponically such as lettuce. Hydroponic growing method harm less insects that randomly fly onto the plants because they are grown indoors. This method is better than raising meat because meat ends lives no matter the method.

          1.5.3.9.1.1. Con:
          Even indoor hydroponic farms suffer from major pest infestations, which require control measures. 
          Indoor Garden Pests [690] 
          Hydroponic Pathogens [691]

      1.5.3.10. Con:
      The argument is an example of Whataboutism [692] aka Tu quoque logical fallacy [693], and therefore does not directly refute the argument that eating meat is wrong.

        1.5.3.10.1. Pro:
        Saying that a practice also causes a negative is not a counter argument. Everything effectively can be shown to create negatives. The issue is not if the practice is pristine and only creates positive outcomes, but the degree to which it creates less negatives. Animal agriculture creates more harm for animals. Animal agriculture includes all the harm of plant based agriculture plus the direct harm of farm animals. Farm animals are fed the plants, and much more than it would take to feed humans.

        1.5.3.10.2. Con:
        In this case, this argument would refute that eating meat is wrong if it were true, since eating plants and fungi is the only alternative to eating meat.

        1.5.3.10.3. Con:
        Whataboutism is a valid argument when there are only two choices, if the alternative is shown to have the same flaw, then both choices would be morally equivalent.

      1.5.3.11. Con:
      Food production for humans will always directly or indirectly disturb the ecosystem of other animals. If we take that as a given then we have to ask ourselves what types of harm to animals and the broader ecosystem are acceptable tradeoffs when producing food.

        1.5.3.11.1. Pro:
        Ethics is not about absolutely eliminating harm, as that is currently impossible, but minimizing it and maximizing benefit.

      1.5.3.12. Con:
      Insects are not what many people would consider "sentient animals", although they technically are. "Minimizing" the harm to a smaller volume of animals, or to animals from a specific phylum is sort of splitting hairs.

      1.5.3.13. Con:
      Most farmed animals live miserable lives on factory farms, which is arguably a more important consideration than the number of animals killed.

      1.5.3.14. Pro:
      The dairy and egg industries cause extreme animal maltreatment that is arguably on a par with the meat and fishing industries.

        1.5.3.14.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.15.3.1.3.5.

        1.5.3.14.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.15.3.1.3.6.

        1.5.3.14.3. Pro:
        In The Netherlands [694], more than half of all dairy cows have no access to pasture and more than a quarter are tied into stalls.

        1.5.3.14.4. Pro:
        Many dairy cows suffer from claw disorders [695] and infections. [696]

        1.5.3.14.5. Pro:
        It is only true in theory that the dairy cows and laying hens are not killed in order to supply these products, but in practice, they are: these animals are usually killed at whatever point the farm considers to be the most profit-maximizing, generally when they have become too old and are used up.

          1.5.3.14.5.1. Con:
          It is possible to implement more ethical farming methods for vegetarian products.

          1.5.3.14.5.2. Pro:
          A cow’s natural lifespan is about 20 years, but cows used by the dairy industry are typically killed [697] after about five years because their bodies wear out from constantly being pregnant or lactating.

          1.5.3.14.5.3. Pro:
          After around two years, when their egg production stops, these “spent” hens are shipped to slaughterhouses [698]. By this time roughly 29% of those hens are suffering from broken bones resulting from neglect and rough treatment.

        1.5.3.14.6. Con:
        While this claim is true, it is not an argument for eating meat, but an argument against use of all forms of animal products.

        1.5.3.14.7. Con:
        This is not a necessary condition of dairy and egg farming. It is possible to treat cows and chickens humanely, and many farms do so. Consumers who seek out products prepared in this way, or who even raise their own cows or chickens, do not contribute to this maltreatment.

          1.5.3.14.7.1. Con:
          It is similarly possible to raise and kill animals in a maximally humane way. So if consumption of dairy is acceptable so long as it is raised in a particular way, the consumption of meat is also acceptable so long as the meat is raised in that way.

            1.5.3.14.7.1.1. Con:
            Killing an animal inevitably and by definition ends its life. This could be considered to be an immoral act however it is carried out, especially as it robs the animal of whatever experiences, pleasure and/or enjoyment it may have got out of the rest of its life. Conversely, keeping animals for non-meat products while treating them humanely and well would allow them to enjoy their full natural lives while producing useful products.

            1.5.3.14.7.1.2. Con:
            Unfortunately, Dairy Cows only produce milk once pregnant (and shortly thereafter). If a calf is male, it is often (even on small farms) killed, as it is more expensive to raise it. Or, it is sold to veal farming, which is inherently cruel (I can explain further if needed). If a calf is female, it's stolen away from the mother and not allowed to drink any of the milk, because the milk must be sold for money for humans. This process, even without overt visible cruelty, is very, very cruel.

          1.5.3.14.7.2. Con:
          There is no such thing as "humane" treatment of animals when the final outcome is slaughter.

    1.5.4. Con:
    As animals lack rights, it is morally permissible to raise them for slaughter.

      1.5.4.1. Pro:
      All predatory species [699] of animals - and even some plants such as the venus fly trap [700] and pitcher plant [701] - consume animal flesh to sustain themselves.

        1.5.4.1.1. Con:
        There is no reason look to animals and plants for moral guidance with regards to eating animals, when we would never do that with regards to any other ethical dilemma.

      1.5.4.2. Con:
      It is immoral to needlessly and intentionally kill a sentient being. In most cases where an animal is killed, it is done for pleasure rather than necessity.

      1.5.4.3. Pro:
      Animals are unable to conceptualise of morality therefore they do not deserve to exist within our moral community.

        1.5.4.3.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.24.1.

        1.5.4.3.2. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.24.1.1.

        1.5.4.3.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.24.2.

        1.5.4.3.4. Pro:
        Animals do not offer rights to one another. Animals hurt and eat one another.

          1.5.4.3.4.1. Con:
          Animals do in fact offer rights to one another. You see this everywhere from ants [702] to chimps [703]. Animals maintain complex social hierarchies both within (linked sources) and across (all symbiotic relationships) species.

          1.5.4.3.4.2. Con:
          The display of "rights" can be clearly portrayed if one were to observe a pack animals that cooperate such as wolves.

            1.5.4.3.4.2.1. Con:
            Most if not all forms of "social" animal groupings are dominated by an alpha animal [704]. Therefore animals only know one right: the right of the strongest.

        1.5.4.3.5. Con:
        Nonhuman animals are unable to engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, nonhuman animals cannot be held to sophisticated moral standards.
        
        Humans on the other hand can engage in sophisticated moral reasoning. Therefore, humans can be held to sophisticated moral standards. This includes standards about how we should or should not behave towards nonhuman animals.

        1.5.4.3.6. Con:
        Animals can conceptualize morals. Dogs and monkeys, for example, have a concept of fairness. Experiments have been done where two monkeys (or dogs) are given different treats for the same trick and those receiving the lesser treat for the same work will become agitated, angry or refuse the treat, even though one bad treat should be better than none.

        1.5.4.3.7. Pro:
        Animals act on instinct and cannot deliberate between actions, therefore they have no moral status. For example, a tiger cannot be made to stand at court for killing a man, neither can a dog. If they can have no regard for human, we cannot have any regard for them. Therefore we can kill animals for food.

        1.5.4.3.8. Pro:
        Humans don't have a moral responsibility to those who they don't think would exhibit the same moral responsibility were they in the same position. You have moral responsibility to a child because they will one day be an adult and you can reasonably expect them to treat you morally. I do not expect cows to have morals besides not being pointlessly sadistic. They would eat me if they could and were hungry, so I feel no qualms about eating them.

          1.5.4.3.8.1. Con:
          But if your point was true, then we should not have a moral responsibilty to a disabled person that will never be able to be "just as moral as you".

        1.5.4.3.9. Con:
        You are not required to be a moral subject in order to become a moral object. Utilitarism, for instance, is not based on the ability to conceptualise right or wrong but by the ability to feel pain or pleasure.

      1.5.4.4. Pro:
      The fact that humans have developed to a greater extent than animals means that they should have the ability to use animals for their own ends.

        1.5.4.4.1. Con:
        Most humans are more developed than infants or severely disabled people. This does not imply that it is ethically permissible to use infants and severely disabled people for any purpose.

          1.5.4.4.1.1. Con:
          Barring a few exceptions, humans in most cultures have drawn a sharp line between what is permissible with fellow humans and with other species. We have created laws and customs, "suspended" the law of nature in order to ensure peaceful coexistence with each other. It is by no means obvious that this should, or even could, be extended to other species.

            1.5.4.4.1.1.1. Con:
            Plenty of natural species do benefit from cooperation and peaceful coexistence outside of their own species. Symbiosis is a widely acknowledged facet of nature. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe humans could not use their reason to further benefit from "unnatural" and "artificial" symbiosis, nor is there any reason to suggest humans should not altruistically use such "artificial" symbiosis to improve the lives of other animals, as long as any downsides are appropriately managed.

        1.5.4.4.2. Con:
        Suggesting that humans should have the ability to use animals for their own ends suggests that they haven't developed to a greater extent than other animals.

        1.5.4.4.3. Con:
        We wouldn't like to be enslaved or killed by a more advanced alien civilization or a much more biologically complex alien species. So we shouldn't do this to animals.

          1.5.4.4.3.1. Pro:
          It has not been disproven that we are not cattle by spiritual beings or aliens too advanced for us to understand. It would be presumptuous to think we are at the top of evolution in the universe.

        1.5.4.4.4. Pro:
        While animals do have some rights, there is no equality between humans and animals, and our behavior to them depends on various criteria such as "is it harmful" or "is it useful". Some animals we try to eradicate, some we keep as pets, some we use for work or we use their wool / milk / meat.
        Nobody cares if we kill rodents that carry diseases and affect crops; it's hypocritical to only "protect" the animals that we enjoy eating.

          1.5.4.4.4.1. Con:
          To morally distinguish between humans and animals, a distinguishing factor must be found, or else it's simply an anthropocentric bias. [705]

        1.5.4.4.5. Con:
        Having a higher state of development does not permit humans the right to do any harm whatsoever.

      1.5.4.5. Con:
      Humans should not have the authority to make decisions about animals given we do not have perfect information about their experiences.

        1.5.4.5.1. Pro:
        Although it is harder to empathize with something you cannot intuitively understand at a glance via biological instincts, this does not mean the other party is not a living being which should have rights - merely that most humans are inherently biased in a specific way.

        1.5.4.5.2. Con:
        There exist times when beings must make decisions that profoundly impact other beings, even thought the experiences of the affected parties cannot be known on a conscious level.

      1.5.4.6. Con:
      Animals should have rights because they are sentient beings.

        1.5.4.6.1. Con:
        Animals do not conceive of pain and death the same way humans do.

          1.5.4.6.1.1. Pro:
          The experience of pain is confounded by the conscious knowledge that pain is being inflicted with intent. Without consciousness pain lacks the existential terror of deliberative motive and merely becomes an unpleasant sensation.

          1.5.4.6.1.2. Con:
          In order to feel pain, one must have some kind of consciousness, because he knows how to distinguish himself from the world. Its like: "It's me who feel pain", and not this stone or this other dog. One must have some kind of conscience of his body in-the-world, in order to feel pain.

            1.5.4.6.1.2.1. Pro:
            If an entity feels pain, then it necessarily has a sense of self, because it can distinguish itself from the world. Self-awareness is, really, necessary to have a conscious feeling of pain, so, something feels pain, then it must be self-aware in some way. The difference between the 'pain' state of mind in different animals cannot be proven, since all of them show us the same phenomena: if, e.g., the ache is in their feet, they scream, stop walking or start limping, etc.

          1.5.4.6.1.3. Pro:
          Most animals do not have preferences about their own futures, like humans do. It is therefore not wrong to kill them.

            1.5.4.6.1.3.1. Con:
            Even if it is not wrong to kill animals, traditional methods of farming cause them significant pain, and animals do clearly have preferences against pain.

          1.5.4.6.1.4. Con:
          Animals will generally attempt to avoid pain (and often become distressed when they believe it is impending, such as during veterinary visits), suggesting that they do not wish to experience it.

        1.5.4.6.2. Pro:
        Animals from a wide range of species have been shown to experience emotions [706] including happiness, grief, empathy and jealousy.

          1.5.4.6.2.1. Con:
          -> See 1.5.2.12.3.14.7.3.

        1.5.4.6.3. Con:
        Sentience is not a sufficient condition for having rights. For example, ants are sentient, but it would be unreasonable to say that they have a right to life.

          1.5.4.6.3.1. Con:
          Sentience is a matter of degree. Farm animals are sufficiently sentient that we should grant them rights.

          1.5.4.6.3.2. Con:
          It would, however, be reasonable to say we should not interfere with them without reason to, thereby implying certain rights to "life" and non-interference.

        1.5.4.6.4. Pro:
        We should grant rights to all sentient beings because there is no consistent way of differentiating between humans (who have rights) and other sentient beings.

          1.5.4.6.4.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.3.9.3.1.3.3.

          1.5.4.6.4.2. Con:
          Humans are participants in a human moral community; this is sufficient to distinguish them from animals.

          1.5.4.6.4.3. Con:
          Since there is no way of knowing how truly 'sentient' or 'non-sentient' something is, drawing the line somewhere on that spectrum between what is and is not sentient would be far more arbitrary than if we just drew the line between human and non-human life.

          1.5.4.6.4.4. Pro:
          The ability to paint some lives as inferior despite the fact that intelligence is relative also allows for human suffering, and assuring the basic protection of all conscious lives would be a step towards a more conscientious global community.

          1.5.4.6.4.5. Pro:
          Humans understand that we feel pain and that other beings can feel pain, including animals. Although they may not understand our pain, we understand theirs, which gives our actions towards them moral weight. If killing is wrong than killing animals is wrong.

        1.5.4.6.5. Con:
        Animals are sentient, but not rational, therefore cannot predict suffering or conceive their fates in slaughter houses. Rights emerge from the prediction of suffering.

          1.5.4.6.5.1. Con:
          This implies unanticipated suffering is morally acceptable.

          1.5.4.6.5.2. Con:
          Animals demonstrate causal reasoning [707] in the same way humans do. For example Pavlov's dogs demonstrate animals can learn about cause and effect, some animals use causal reasoning to make tools [708]and crows can reason about hidden causal agents in a way which was incorrectly believed to be unique to humans. [709]

          1.5.4.6.5.3. Con:
          Animals demonstrate grief [710] which implies that they are able to reason about suffering.

          1.5.4.6.5.4. Con:
          Animals will try to save themselves or other members of their group when they reason that their lives are in danger.  Therefore they can predict suffering.

          1.5.4.6.5.5. Con:
          'Rights' are a human-created concept with the dominant 'class or species' deciding the rules. Many ethnic minorities don't receive the same 'rights' (treatment) because of this; and we should consider animals as in a similarly marginalised position.

        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.14.

        1.5.4.6.7. Con:
        Animals are not as self aware as humans, so they would not be aware of their coming death until it's already happened. Especially as the methods of doing so are quick and painless.

          1.5.4.6.7.1. Pro:
          Example of a farm which uses painless methods: youtu.be [711]

        1.5.4.6.8. Pro:
        Non-human animals, just like humans, are sencient and have a conscience. The conscience issue has been stated by 'The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness [712]' issued by a prominent international group of cognitive neuroscientists,
        neuropharmacologists, neurophysiologists, neuroanatomists and computational neuroscientists gathered at The University of Cambridge.

        1.5.4.6.9. Pro:
        If we accept the fact that killing humans is wrong, as we are sentient beings, so is the killing of animals wrong as well. It is a clear fact that animals feel pain, join, etc. Some of them live among us as fellows, helpers...so if that's the reality for some that should be for all of them. It would be fair that way.

      1.5.4.7. Con:
      Eating meat violates animals' right to life.

        1.5.4.7.1. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.1.

        1.5.4.7.2. Pro:
        Animals desire to continue existing. This is sufficient to grant them a right to life.

          1.5.4.7.2.1. Con:
          Simply having a desire does not constitute having a fundamental right. Rights are constructed by humans to make sense of laws of nature that a living things needs in order to survive. Nature constantly uses death to create new life. It is a beautiful circle that we are a part of.

            1.5.4.7.2.1.1. Con:
            The only reason animals have not human-given rights is because we have chosen not to give rights to them. By their own existence, they have the right to life.

              1.5.4.7.2.1.1.1. Con:
              Rights are a social construct for regulating the behaviour of humans within a society, and only function because humans are capable of conceptualizing the ideas of rights and responsibilities. Therefore, the reason that animals have not been given human rights may be because they are not applicable to most animals by definition.

              1.5.4.7.2.1.1.2. Con:
              Rights only exist in the minds of humans, so does the 'right to life'. Therefore, the claim contradicts itself.

          1.5.4.7.2.2. Con:
          Such a right would be internally inconsistent. Prey animals would then have a right to life which if policed by humans would deny a right of life to their natural predators which would then starve.

            1.5.4.7.2.2.1. Con:
            There is a difference between policing and moderating our own actions, and attempting to police the entire natural world by our standards.

          1.5.4.7.2.3. Pro:
          Animals have emotions, social systems, instincts, and intelligence. Humans should respect their existence. We have evolved and no longer need to prey on animals for our existence.

        1.5.4.7.3. Con:
        With that logic, eating plants, fruits or vegetables also violates their right to life. There is nothing wrong with the occurrence of natural selection and the circle of life.

          1.5.4.7.3.1. Con:
          Fruiting plants' fruiting bodies are deliberately grown to be removed and eaten in order to spread the plant's seeds, and are not essential to its individual survival. Fruiting plants are easily capable of withstanding the loss of nutrients which go into producing fruit and continuing to thrive, while killing an animal for meat outright ends that animal's life permanently.

          1.5.4.7.3.2. Con:
          There is no "natural selection" occurring on a farm in any case unless certain animals are deliberately spared the harvest for specific reasons, and/or deliberately used to breed - and even then, this is preferential breeding and not natural selection. Animals born and bred on farms are not naturally occurring specimens.

          1.5.4.7.3.3. Con:
          "Their right to life" implies a personhood which isn't a characteristic the scientific community agrees plants have. The correct phrase is "its right to life", which plants don't have.

        1.5.4.7.4. Con:
        Animals have no rights because they have no obligations.

          1.5.4.7.4.1. Con:
          Animals are living beings with the right to not be inflicted with unnecessary suffering or unjustly killed outside of an extraordinary emergency.

          1.5.4.7.4.2. Pro:
          Every right one possesses imposes a responsibility on all parties to respect it. As animals are incapable of following this responsibility, they are not offered them.

          1.5.4.7.4.3. Con:
          Animal rights can correspond to human obligations, but not any obligations from other animals.

        1.5.4.7.5. Con:
        Nature doesn't give animals a right to life. It kills them cruelly and in great numbers.

      1.5.4.8. Con:
      Animals do in fact have rights. Many forms of cruelty are explicitly outlawed. One cannot, for instance, torture a dog for years in their basement. Therefore the statement that animals do not have rights is fundamentally false.

        1.5.4.8.1. Con:
        Humans have legal (and ethical) obligations with respect to animals, but that doesn't mean animals have reciprocal rights (they cannot sue, be awarded damages, etc.). Our obligations to animals exist as a matter of appropriate human behavior, not something that belongs to the animal.

          1.5.4.8.1.1. Con:
          Our current treatment of animals is not appropriate human behaviour (factory farming, mass slaughter, etc.).

            1.5.4.8.1.1.1. Con:
            That can be true without supporting the proposition that eating meat is per se unethical

              1.5.4.8.1.1.1.1. Con:
              Eating meat inevitably requires causing an animal's death (unless meat is scavenged, which is not practical today), and usually (varying degrees of) suffering beforehand. If one argues that appropriate human behaviour/ethics is/involves harm minimization, this is inappropriate and unethical human behaviour.

          1.5.4.8.1.2. Con:
          Our obligations to other humans exist solely as a matter of appropriate human behavior as well. And an impaired human might also not be able to "sue" or handle "money," and yet they would (or would not) have rights just like animals would (or would not) -- with perfect symmetry. Any model of what "Rights" are supposed to be can be shown to apply simultaneously to all animals, not just the human animal.

            1.5.4.8.1.2.1. Con:
            This isn't correct as a legal matter. An impaired human without the capacity to sue for themselves will have a guardian appointed to act on their behalf. No equivalent process exists for animals. As a legal matter, animals do not have rights.

              1.5.4.8.1.2.1.1. Con:
              This is conflation of law with morality. [713]

              1.5.4.8.1.2.1.2. Con:
              Humans have taken it on themselves to sue for animal's rights.

          1.5.4.8.1.3. Con:
          For morality to exist, there should be reciprocity. It is suicidal [714] to recognize moral rights to animals, when we know we can't trust them to do the same towards us.

        1.5.4.8.2. Con:
        The original statement this is responding to was indicating that animals "lack rights".  That is not false.  We do not live in a completely free society, and there are rules and laws which permit and prohibit certain behaviors.  Animals are lacking certain rights- in that humans are given rights which animals are not, such as a dog cannot walk unleashed in public areas.  Contrarily people lack certain rights which animals have, such as dogs being able to defecate in public.

      1.5.4.9. Pro:
      Rights by their nature correspond to duties. Since the actions of animals lack moral content they can't be said to have duties; we don't talk about a tiger or a cow being morally good or bad, or assign moral obligations to them, because by their nature they are not rational beings.

        1.5.4.9.1. Con:
        Rights do not correspond to duties by nature. The definition of rights talks solely about entitlements that are granted to an individual. There are lots of humans (e.g. mentally disabled people) that are granted rights without bearing duties. Also "duties" is very vague.

        1.5.4.9.2. Con:
        By this reasoning, if humans have the right to raise animals, then we also have a corresponding duty of care towards those animals.

        1.5.4.9.3. Con:
        The claim that animals are not rational beings is debated. This book gives an overview of the different studies on animal rationality and interpretations of the term rationality philpapers.org [715]. Since it is not clear that animals are not rational beings, you cannot just assume their actions lack moral content. And even if their actions lacked moral content to them, this might not be the case for us, as human beings interpreting their behaviour.

        1.5.4.9.4. Con:
        Humans should not predate other species for the sake of it, only as and when it's out of necessity.

        1.5.4.9.5. Con:
        No one argued the moral onus to not eat meat was on the animals. We as humans have rights and therefore duties.

        1.5.4.9.6. Pro:
        People should treat things (other humans, animals, plants, or minerals) according to their natures. It is natural for a prey animal to be eaten, and so there is nothing immoral in eating it.

          1.5.4.9.6.1. Pro:
          All life suffers, and all life dies. Furthermore, all life inevitably results in the suffering and death of other life. Competition for food and habitat, predation, competition to reproduce...all of this happens even without human influence, even in microbial ecosystems. So the logical conclusion of this claim is that life itself is cruel and immoral. It is a spiritual, subjective, and therefore unsubstantiated claim. One cannot possibly know the truth.

            1.5.4.9.6.1.1. Con:
            If you adopt this mindset, you could justify doing anything - stealing, rape, murder. All life suffers after all. Furthermore, most of todays meat eating is not competition for food, but done for pleasure.

            1.5.4.9.6.1.2. Con:
            There was once a man who said that the mysteries of the human body were mysteries infinitely beyond the comprehension of science. Modern medicine would rather put an egg on his face. Any claim that certain knowledge is impossible to possess is one which should be viewed with scepticism, as there is no knowledge which is arbitrarily and absolutely incomprehensible.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.2.1. Con:
              Unless you are familiar with the means by which human beings can flourish without creating suffering, or you can provide sources, this claim is irrelevant.

                1.5.4.9.6.1.2.1.1. Con:
                The argument is that if we continue searching, we will - or may - eventually find.
                
                More practically, there are uninhabited planets, and vast swathes of empty space, on and in which a sufficiently advanced humanity could live without disturbing any other living creature. And this is only one possibility of many.

            1.5.4.9.6.1.3. Con:
            Suffering is unpleasant, and all sufficiently conscious animals attempt to avoid it. (Even less conscious animals reflexively avoid pain!) This suggests it is something we should not deliberately inflict, and take reasonable steps to avoid inflicting in others, as well as avoiding ourselves. Even if we cannot perfect the world, we should attempt to improve it.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.3.1. Con:
              Yes. All conscious beings avoid suffering....to the detriment of other life. Everything any being does to alleviate its own suffering causes suffering in other beings.

                1.5.4.9.6.1.3.1.1. Con:
                This is evidently not true. If I am in an uncomfortable physical position, for instance, I can change position to make myself more comfortable without affecting any other living thing.

            1.5.4.9.6.1.4. Con:
            If life only produced suffering and negative experiences, this argument may hold water. However, life also produces joy and pleasure and enjoyable experiences. As such, according to Utilitarianism [716] and similar ethical theories, our "job" or at least the most moral courses of action are to minimize suffering while maximizing pleasure and pleasant experiences.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.4.1. Con:
              Life creates both suffering and joy, but suffering is unavoidable. [717]

                1.5.4.9.6.1.4.1.1. Con:
                You cannot simply link another (unsupported) claim as "evidence". Furthermore, even if this were 100% true, it would still be possible to attempt to create the most joy possible while creating the least suffering possible. Neither of these claims rebuts the ultimate point, which is that even if perfection is impossible, improvement is not.

            1.5.4.9.6.1.5. Con:
            This claim is invoking moral skepticism - there is no objective basis for wrong and right. Holding this position is extremely impractical as it permits all human behaviour and it follows that actions such as murder and rape- both observable in non-human life- are acceptable. 
            
            In reality, this is not the case. Human behaviour is governed by norms whose content is subjective but whose existence  is not. Subjective though it may be, we accept that there are principles of right and wrong.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.5.1. Con:
              The objective basis for wrong and right is provided by the system of morality used in the situation. The claim assumes that there is an objective right and wrong, which is ex definitio contradictory.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.5.2. Con:
              This claim inaccurately describes its parent. The parent claim is questioning the objectivity of ITS parent, and questioning the authority of the claimant to rule on the morality of participating in the circle of life by eating meat. The claimant argues that it is in fact cynical to pass judgment on the natural circle of life and those who participate in it. The claimant argues that it is impossible, and in fact immoral, for humans to pass judgment on life itself.

              1.5.4.9.6.1.5.3. Con:
              The norm for human behavior is not to extend all human rights to all animal life.

          1.5.4.9.6.2. Con:
          No "prey" animal is eaten by its own nature, rather because other animals evolve to prey on it.

          1.5.4.9.6.3. Con:
          Morality is not predicated upon the nature of or actions of others.

          1.5.4.9.6.4. Con:
          Humans treat all sorts of things unnaturally: for example, using animal products to create glue, or minerals to create computers. Clearly humans have the capacity to go beyond a thing's "natural purpose."

          1.5.4.9.6.5. Con:
          When most humans see slaughter houses, they feel discomfort [718] whereas if a carnivore animal saw one they'd feel hunger and likely attempt to eat the animal there and then. Therefore it can no longer be considered our nature to treat animals as prey or act as if we are instinctually predators.

        1.5.4.9.7. Con:
        The claim that animals don't have rights, because rights equate with duty is an outdated one made by Kant, Descartes, and others. We now have greater insight- and more questions- about animal intelligence and the nature of consciousness in general, so can no longer hold these claims as valid arguments.

        1.5.4.9.8. Con:
        Rights correspond to duties that moral agents have towards the holder of rights, not necessarily duties that the holder of rights has.

        1.5.4.9.9. Con:
        Rights are based on the ability to suffer, not on the ability to think rationally.

        1.5.4.9.10. Con:
        By this logic we should be able to eat severely mentally disabled people or the insane, since many of them are incapable of acting with moral content (which is why they often can not be held criminally liable for their actions). Clearly that would be immoral. For the same reasons, this argument is flawed.

        1.5.4.9.11. Con:
        The rights of animals can correspond to the duties of humans, but not to duties of other animals.

      1.5.4.10. Con:
      Animals not having rights doesn't imply in any way that killing and torturing them for our consumption is moral.

        1.5.4.10.1. Con:
        If torturing animals is immoral, it follows that it would be logical to create rights for these animals.

        1.5.4.10.2. Pro:
        That logic is used for torturing "terrorists". We created the Geneva convention in order to fight "respectfully". Animals deserve the same if we want to claim moral superiority.

        1.5.4.10.3. Pro:
        No living being should be killed for food when there are other,widely accessible alternatives.

      1.5.4.11. Pro:
      Animals lack free will.

        1.5.4.11.1. Con:
        Free will is seen in many species [719].

        1.5.4.11.2. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.8.2.1.1.

        1.5.4.11.3. Pro:
        As a human, we know that we make choices and we also see each other making choices. Animals, by contrast, mostly seem to be biotic machines, always trying to get the components they need to run, and spread.

          1.5.4.11.3.1. Con:
          The same argument could be made of all observed human behaviours - we could be simply more complex biotic machines with more complex goals, and able to delude ourselves into thinking we have free will as we are driven to follow those goals.

        1.5.4.11.4. Con:
        Many animals have demonstrated free will through play, associations and affections with humans and other animals, and more. Anyone who has owned a cat can attest that animals demonstrate free will; dolphins and primates also frequently exhibit it.

          1.5.4.11.4.1. Con:
          The ability of something to exhibit complex behaviour does not imply that that thing has free will. For example, computer simulations can simulate playful behaviour, but they do not have free will.

        1.5.4.11.5. Con:
        Because something lacks 'free will', does not mean it is incapable of suffering.

        1.5.4.11.6. Con:
        Assuming humans have free will, there's just as much reason to believe some animals do as well. Many of them have highly complex minds and problem-solving ability, crows being a good example. Contrary to popular belief, pigs are also highly intelligent.

        1.5.4.11.7. Con:
        There is no "moral" way to kill an innocent animal who thinks, feels and wants to live — just like humans do.

          1.5.4.11.7.1. Con:
          Animals are neither innocent nor guilty; these are human categories which cannot be applied to animals.

        1.5.4.11.8. Con:
        Speciesism is the ideology that one species is 'better than' another simply because they view their species specific abilities as inherently more valueable than that of another species. Many humans view cognition as the valuable human attribute that raises the value of our species above that of other animals, however, each animal contributes to the health and well-being of the planet in their own unique way, and it is impossible to categorize one characteristic as more valuable than the next.

      1.5.4.12. Con:
      There is no trait that makes animals different than humans that if the same logic were applied to a human, it would justify farming that human as meat.

        1.5.4.12.1. Con:
        If it were true that there was no difference between humans and animals that allowed humans right animals did not have, it would be unjustifiable to deny animals the right to vote. Not many people are pushing for the full citizenship of gerbils. Therefore, there must exist some characteristic that allows humans rights animals do not have.

        1.5.4.12.4. Pro:
        Eating animals is like eating "stupid" people. We don't eat "stupid" people. We are not good at assessing intelligence, looking back at human history: complex cultures seeing tribal cultures as stupid & barbaric, believing birds are "stupid" due to the size of their brain (they can actually use tools), and believing animals are nothing like humans (animals show love, empathy, remembers if you have wronged them, etc,). Just because they don't speak our "language", it shouldn't make them food.

        1.5.4.12.5. Pro:
        Any criteria on which we justify the eating of animals would have to be applied to non-human species right to eat humans.

        1.5.4.12.6. Pro:
        Using the body of someone (an animal) against its will is a violation of the right to bodily autonomy; the right not to be used as a means against one's will. To avoid discrimination, everyone who has a will and a perception of their own body, including sentient animals, should get this right.

      1.5.4.13. Pro:
      Animals are only given rights by us. If we were, as a society, to say that animals don’t have rights then they wouldn’t have rights. Ethics aren’t inherent for beings that aren’t capable of complex thought. A dog is only able to understand that the rumble in their stomach means they’re hungry — they can’t contemplate whether or not they truly exist or what it means to know something.

        1.5.4.13.1. Con:
        The same arbitrary extension extends to human people. We extend rights to humans as long as they do not pose a threat to arbitrary legal standards. Much of this is fear-based and mistaken - decidedly amoral. Right and Wrong is a moral argument, not a legal argument.

        1.5.4.13.2. Con:
        As living beings, animals should have rights if other living beings of similar traits are given rights, unless a meaningful distinction can be made.

        1.5.4.13.3. Con:
        We have very limited knowledge of the mental state of animals. We can only make observations, not irrefutable judgements on their inner mental states.

      1.5.4.14. Con:
      Rights are socially constructed by fallible and limited humans. Animals not having enforced 'rights' does not mean that it is okay to do anything to animals, only that the humans in a position of power creating rights did not think it worthwhile to give them rights.

        1.5.4.14.1. Pro:
        Animals not having recognised legal rights does not mean that killing them is an acceptable or appropriate course of action.

          1.5.4.14.1.1. Pro:
          What is permissible and what is advisable are entirely separate matters.
          
          For example, rocks do not have feelings or rights, they fit in our mouths, and it is not presently illegal to eat them. None of these facts have a bearing on the question "should humans eat rocks?"

            1.5.4.14.1.1.1. Con:
            It is not an inherent part of human nature and biology to eat rocks, making this analogy flawed.

              1.5.4.14.1.1.1.1. Con:
              It is not an established intrinsic component of human nature or biology to eat meat either.

              1.5.4.14.1.1.1.2. Con:
              This analogy is meant only to illustrate one distinction between what is advisable and what is permissible. Which is a distinct and separate claim, completely outside the purview of human nature or biology.

          1.5.4.14.1.2. Pro:
          When black people in America didn't have human rights it was not ethically correct for other people to kill them. The law isn't an arbiter of morality.

            1.5.4.14.1.2.1. Con:
            People had no problem killing their slaves, as long as they were there's to kill. They were beaten and worked to death on the regular.

              1.5.4.14.1.2.1.1. Con:
              Just because people did, doesn't mean it was morally correct to do so.

            1.5.4.14.1.2.3. Pro:
            A lack of legal rights says nothing about innate rights.

          1.5.4.14.1.3. Pro:
          Morals are not the consequence of law. Law is derived from a pool of morals, and actions are derived from laws. In this way, laws do not represent morals effectively. Just because eating meat is legal and growing animals to be eaten is legal does not mean that eating meat is not morally wrong.

          1.5.4.14.1.4. Con:
          Well if you waited for them to die naturally, then they’d be unusable, you can’t eat them or use their hides for things, therefore you’re wasting that animals life.

            1.5.4.14.1.4.1. Con:
            The argument is that killing animals is not an acceptable or appropriate course of action, therefore they should not be kept or bred for the eventual purpose of killing them and gaining material benefit from their death.

        1.5.4.14.2. Pro:
        This argument begs the question. If a thing should not have rights because it does not have rights than progress is impossible. Slave did not have rights but they should have.

          1.5.4.14.2.1. Con:
          This assumes that morality is absolute.  Slaves should not have had rights, for example. Because we are judging a distant past by the moral standards of today, and not by the moral standards of the time. So your example does not prove your claim. An argument can be made that whatever *is* ought to be. Standards can only evolve naturally within culture and not through vast policy or legal impositions.

            1.5.4.14.2.1.1. Con:
            Slavery causes undue and injust harm. Therefore, it is cruel and immoral.

            1.5.4.14.2.1.2. Con:
            Laws and policies can force, or act as a catalyst or encouragement for societal change. It may not be an immediate 100% change, but at least some law-abiding citizens will follow the new rules, while others will be forced to debate and dispute and protest rather than merely continue on as they always have.

        1.5.4.14.3. Pro:
        It has been argued, primarily by the 'abolitionist vegan,Gary Francione [722], that the one right that all sentient beings process is the right 'not to be owned.'

        Dolphins seen as 'non-human' persons by Indian Government [723] in order to ban their captivity.

        1.5.4.14.5. Pro:
        Throughout history slaves did not have any rights. That does not make slavery moral. Denying people who were slaves their rights was morally corrupt. It is immoral to deny rights to animals- the right to live (or to not be brought into existence through intensive breeding for the purposes of slaughtering them), the right not to suffer unnecessarily.

        1.5.4.14.6. Pro:
        Rights are a human construct which do not exist in nature and are not universal across culture, geography or history.  If human's wish to grant or deny rights to animals, or even other humans, they can.

        1.5.4.14.7. Pro:
        Does this apply to humans? You say animals without rights, rights are bestowed by groups of people from time to time. Slaves have not had 'rights' in the past, does their lack of rights mean they should be farmed for meat?

      1.5.4.15. Pro:
      From a utilitarian metric, life itself has no value, but rather the emotions experienced in life is what matters. The way we harvest animals is considerably less painful than how a vast majority of animals will die naturally — such as being slowly torn apart by their predators.

        1.5.4.15.1. Pro:
        Keeping animals for slaughtering is a lot more humane then letting them die through natural ways such as predation, starvation or disease.

          1.5.4.15.1.1. Con:
          -> See 1.5.2.5.1.2.2.

          1.5.4.15.1.2. Pro:
          Indeed, keeping animals for slaughter who never knew freedom or happiness is arguably more ethical than capturing free beings in the wild with painful traps, no regard for offspring/mates, and potential waste. Not to mention the effect on the ecosystem of free-range hunting in the quantities currently demanded.

          1.5.4.15.1.3. Pro:
          Eating animals that have been raised in a responsible environment and killed humanely offers a better life than most ever obtain from living wild.

            1.5.4.15.1.3.3. Pro:
            Most animals that live in captivity are unable to fend for themselves in the wild. Therefore, not eating animals would inevitably lead to their extinction

              1.5.4.15.1.3.3.1. Con:
              If natural processes means that a species will eventually go extinct, then so be it. Humans should never (try to) interfere with nature.

                1.5.4.15.1.3.3.1.1. Con:
                Farmed animals are not the result of natural evolution; humans have bred and conditioned them for hundreds of years. Thus, humans have a responsibility to care for those beings.

            1.5.4.15.1.3.4. Con:
            Animals aren't always killed in a humane way, and in fact, most of the time, it's quicker to kill them inhumanely.

            1.5.4.15.1.3.5. Con:
            Killing can never be done humanely as killing is always an immoral action.

          1.5.4.15.1.4. Pro:
          Healthy farm animals fit into a healthy farm system like wild animals fit into a wild ecosystem. In domesticating live stock we have created animals that are most comfortable in agricultural (rather than wild) conditions.

            1.5.4.15.1.4.1. Con:
            Current farming systems are not healthy in any way, shape, or form.

              1.5.4.15.1.4.1.1. Pro:
              There are many cruel and unnatural practices on today's farms, such as overcrowding (and resultant disease spread) from "factory" and "battery" farming, unanaesthetized mutilation such as de-beaking, simple neglect (whether due to bulk of animals in the farm or simple carelessness), etc.

              1.5.4.15.1.4.1.2. Pro:
              (Over)use of artificial (or supplementary) hormones negatively affects both the health of the animals and the consumer.

              1.5.4.15.1.4.1.3. Pro:
              Many naturally occuring ecosystems are under a threat because of factory farming.

          1.5.4.15.1.5. Con:
          It is not just that humans keep animals for slaughtering, but that they produce animals for the specific purpose of slaughtering and eating them. Without the meat industry, these animals would not need to be bred in such numbers and less animals would be killed.

          1.5.4.15.1.6. Pro:
          Other animals eat animals too. For humans, as for these animals, it is therefore only natural.

            1.5.4.15.1.6.1. Con:
            This argument implies the necessity of killing for survival. Humans do not depend on killing and eating animals for their survival, and certainly not through the mass-breeding of animals with the sole purpose of killing them.

              1.5.4.15.1.6.1.1. Con:
              Humans might not depend on mass-breeding animals with the sole purpose of killing them, but animals eating animals is how nature functions, so I'm not sure that this argument has weight in this particular thread.

                1.5.4.15.1.6.1.1.1. Con:
                Eating animals may be how nature functions, but humans have evolved beyond how nature functions. Humans  consider things like pain inflicted on others, where as nature just sees them as food.

                  1.5.4.15.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  If humans are the only creature to evolve beyond nature, then laws beyond nature should only apply to humans.

              1.5.4.15.1.6.1.2. Con:
              Although there are many problems with factory farming, the implicit assumption that all forms of consuming meat are wrong because of a more extreme example is false equivalency; while we don't depend on meat, meat is a good source of protein [724], & alsoanimal proteins are more easily absorbed by the body [725].

          1.5.4.15.1.7. Pro:
          While we should aim to reduce and eventually eliminate the suffering of animals, vegetarianism is a tacit demand for the extinction of all domesticated animals used for food.
          If an animal living in the wild were given the choice of being guaranteed food, shelter, and procreation knowing that their eventual demise would be painless and provide their ancestors a similar lifestyle, they would likely agree to live under those conditions rather than suffer in the wild.

            1.5.4.15.1.7.1. Con:
            Your argument boils down to the claim that domesticated animals are better off than wild animals, with the counterfactual choice of the latter as a rhetorical tool. Even if we accepted your claim that wild animals have "worse" lives, if would not logically mean that the unneccesary suffering  of animals raised for food could be justified (similar faulty reasoning would be to claim that the poor in the US are better off than people in 3rd world slums and so they need no sympathy)

          1.5.4.15.1.8. Con:
          If we did not raise animals for meat, those farm animals would not exist in the wild; rather, they would simply not exist.

            1.5.4.15.1.8.1. Pro:
            Since the lives of most animals raised for meat are plausibly worse than death, nonexistence is preferable for them.

          1.5.4.15.1.9. Con:
          We are not morally culpable for the deaths of animals in the wild. By contrast, we are morally culpable for suffering we deliberately inflict.

          1.5.4.15.1.10. Con:
          Not keeping an animal at all is therefore even "more humane" compared to both of these options. We should therefore, as intelligent beings, choose the best option possible and not keep animals at all, since we don`t need to do so.

        1.5.4.15.2. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.5.1.2.2.

        1.5.4.15.3. Pro:
        The consumption of prey animals by humans is significantly more humane in comparison to how these creatures are hunted and ripped apart in the wild by their natural predators.
        
        Refusing to eat meat does NOT prevent brutal, bloody or painful animal death.  Human consumption of meat in fact reduces that pain and suffering by ensuring the creatures are clean, healthy and unspoiled before being humanely killed for later consumption.

        1.5.4.15.4. Con:
        Beeing kept in narrow spaces and very likely has a negative utilitarian value. The utilitarian value of nonexistence is neutral. Since the animals we eat exist specifically for this purpose, not eating meat would lead to a neutral utilitarian value instead of a negative value.

        1.5.4.15.5. Con:
        Life has a high amount of value in utilitarian terms because prematurely dying means not being able to experience the positive emotions you would otherwise. The prematurely short lives of animals raised just to maturity for meat is probably a larger utility loss than how they end up dying.

          1.5.4.15.5.1. Con:
          In utilitarian terms, ten animals that live for one year each in succession, and one animal that lives for ten years, if they experience the same utility, have the same moral value. Hence, there is no lost utility when meat animals die "prematurely" as long as the population does not shrink.

        1.5.4.15.6. Con:
        Utilitarianism is not the most valid measure of moral value. Often, principles such as "killing is wrong" are considered to be a moral law despite the fact that this may lead to higher level of happiness.

          1.5.4.15.6.1. Con:
          It can only be said that there is a more or less valid measure of moral value if there is a True (objective) Morality to be closer to or further from. If there is such a True Morality, it wouldn't be affected by what humans thought, because anyone who disagrees is objectively wrong. Hence, the fact that people often consider deontological principles to be valid moral rules cannot indicate that utilitarianism is a less valid measure of moral value than others.

      1.5.4.16. Con:
      -> See 1.5.2.1.3.1.2.

      1.5.4.17. Con:
      Historically, there have been times when certain categories of humans did not ‘have rights.’ Many of those rights were denied due to a supposed ‘inferiority’ to groups in power, who possessed ‘rights.’ In some cases, those humans were born explicitly for exploitation. We now regognize how wrong those policies are and have been working past the problematic moral dilemmas and inequities these policies caused. It’s a moral imperative that we do the same with other species.

        1.5.4.17.1. Con:
        This is a mischaracterisation of the history of philosophy; the understanding of fundamental or natural rights that we are referring to when we talk about rights in a modern context has been connected with a belief that all humans have the same rights since the concept began [726] with the Stoics.

        1.5.4.17.2. Con:
        While that might be the case within humanity as a group one can't apply the same standards for a different species entirely.

      1.5.4.18. Con:
      Rights are inalienable and "endowed by our creator". They are not given just by law which why it is morally defensible to challenge laws that attempt to deny rights. Even though current law does not give rights to animals, it does not mean that animals do not have them under the principles through which the concept of rights was created.

      1.5.4.19. Pro:
      In most religions, animals lack souls/spirits, putting them decisively into a different moral category than humans, permitting a different set of ethics.

        1.5.4.19.1. Con:
        This is just a common belief fallacy [727]. A belief is not true simply because a lot of people hold it.

        1.5.4.19.2. Con:
        Ethics should not be based on beliefs that aren't falsifiable. Until religious people can prove that non-human animals don't have souls (which they likely can't), and can effectively argue that lack of a soul permits us to kill non-human animals, then this statement carries no weight.

    1.5.5. Pro:
    For most people, eating meat is needless and the needless killing of beings with a will to live is immoral.

      1.5.5.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.4.6.3.

      1.5.5.2. Con:
      Those people don't have to eat it. No one is forcing anyone to eat meat, so there is no need to tell people who enjoy it to stop. There are plenty of other arguments in this thread related to the morals of the animal kingdom.

      1.5.5.3. Con:
      Why is it immoral? Would you say it is also immoral for the average person to kill a spider in their house? They don't NEED to kill the spider most of the time.

        1.5.5.3.1. Con:
        There are, in fact, better (and more natural) ways to manage pests than indiscriminately killing with pesticides. Naturally derived repellents are available and viable.

      1.5.5.4. Pro:
      Animals' lives are wasted when their meat is not eaten (due to spoiling...), causing them to suffer needlessly and thus die in vain.

        1.5.5.4.1. Con:
        Vegetarian diets are also not free from wasted lives.Jain vegetarians place value on plant lives [728]. If a root vegetable goes to waste, they would believe that that plant died in vain.

        1.5.5.4.2. Pro:
        Most meat comes from a killed animal, whereas not all vegetarian foods come from a killed animal or plant (such as fruit). Thus, a vegetarian diet could be cruelty-free for wasted food.

        1.5.5.4.3. Pro:
        Even waste from vegan food makes up for the loss (that meat cannot achieve) multi-fold. For example, not eating fruit helps the plant that wasted fruit came from. Here, the cycle of life continues because a person can plant the seeds to grow a new fruit tree that bears more fruits. This more than makes up for the one fruit that went to waste.

        1.5.5.4.4. Pro:
        This is bad, because it accomplishes little and instead makes the world worse off than before.

          1.5.5.4.4.1. Pro:
          The animals could have a better purpose or be utilized better (such as providing companionship to someone or providing other food like milk).

          1.5.5.4.4.2. Pro:
          More resources are used to make up for what is lost. For example, another animal has to be raised for the meat that went spoiled.

            1.5.5.4.4.2.1. Pro:
            This causes more animals to die than if the animal did not die in vain (such as if the meat is eaten right away, another animal does not have to die to make up for the lost meat).

      1.5.5.5. Pro:
      Causing unnecessary harm should be avoided on ethical grounds. Eating meat clearly does cause unnecessary harm, unless our survival depends upon it. Since humans can thrive without eating meat, it is an unethical thing to do.

      1.5.5.6. Pro:
      Many revered thinkers and most of the collectively recognized geniuses [729] of every age followed and promoted some form of vegetarian diets (Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, da Vinci, Francis of Assisi, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Tesla, Edison, Tolstoy, Franklin, Luther King… and far more recurrent among the Eastern philosophy figures. Also in modern times of every discipline: Van Gogh, Kafka, Henry Ford, Stephen Hawkins, Antoni Gaudí, Bill Gates, Carl Lewis, Matt Groening, etc) en.wikipedia.org [730]

    1.5.6. Pro:
    Conscious vegetarianism facilitates compassion towards other living beings and discourages us from viewing them as mere ingredients to a recipe.

      1.5.6.1. Con:
      It is hard to feel sympathy for being one never sees, or interacts with, even if the alternative is only seeing them as part of a meal.

      1.5.6.2. Con:
      Many who eat meat also feel compassion towards other animals. It is very possible to research where your meat comes from to ensure that no cruel methods were used in raising the animal, and in the case of hunting, thinning the population allows for expansion of resources, allowing the survivors a greater ability to thrive. This also allows their offspring more room to grow with less competition.

      1.5.6.3. Con:
      Conscious vegetarianism facilitates a lack of compassion toward other living beings because they see plants as mere ingredients to a recipe.

        1.5.6.3.1. Con:
        Plants are able to survive losing a large portion of their biomass, and many produce fruiting bodies deliberately intended for consumption by animals. Meanwhile, harvesting an animal for meat kills it 100% of the time. It is more possible to compassionately harvest (some) plants than animals.

      1.5.6.4. Pro:
      Specifically, it facilitates the reduction of suffering among living beings capable of suffering. Reducing suffering is good.

        1.5.6.4.1. Con:
        Not all moral systems are centred on the reduction of suffering.

          1.5.6.4.1.1. Pro:
          Some moral systems (i.e., deontologically-based [731] ones) classify actions - or even thoughts, goals, and ideals - as right or wrong, and are effectively based around maximizing "right" actions and avoiding or reducing "wrong" ones.

        1.5.6.4.2. Con:
        If reducing suffering is the only measure of good, the logical conclusion is that we must end all life to end all suffering. This is inherently wrong.

        1.5.6.4.3. Con:
        If reducing suffering is good, but we do not have to end suffering entirely, then responsible farming of domesticated livestock accomplishes this end, as few domesticated animals living in these circumstances will suffer as much, or die as miserably as their wild counterparts.

        1.5.6.4.4. Con:
        If the only moral factor is 'reducing suffering is good', then a responsible hunter who kills their prey quickly is more moral than a vegan who eats foods harvested from large fields where animals are caught and maimed by harvesting equipment. The hunter is more responsible than that same group because field crops cause animals to reproduce more quickly, only to have their food supply eliminated as winter approaches, with few natural predators nearby to bring them swifter death than starvation.

        1.5.6.4.5. Con:
        I don't think we can say definitively that it reduces suffering. Are plants capable of suffering? I know some would say so. Are insects capable of suffering? How would you define suffering? Is one creature's suffering more relevant than another's? Which is worse, the death and suffering of a million insects, a hundred mice, or a single cow?

      1.5.6.5. Pro:
      A large majority of meat eaters either have a pet, want one or watch cute cat videos with an "aww" type of reaction. That again shows the fact that we have the innate ability to think compassionately about animals and not think of them as supper.

        1.5.6.5.1. Pro:
        It also shows, once again, that we are irrationally biased towards certain animals.

        1.5.6.5.2. Con:
        Thinking compassionately about animals and thinking of them as supper are not mutually exlusive. In fact, the vast majority of farmers producing meat think very compassionately about their animals and ensure their well-being. Not just for economic, but for moral and compassionate reasons.

      1.5.6.6. Con:
      The above claimant presumes to know what human beings "feel" when they eat meat, and how those human beings view life. It is an inaccurate representation, and therefore it is invalid.

      1.5.6.7. Con:
      Conscious living facilitates compassion toward other living beings. Vegetarianism is not a necessary component of this.

      1.5.6.8. Pro:
      By consuming farmed meat you are ingesting the suffering and trauma those animal experienced in their short lives [732] which has potential metaphysical consequences we cannot comprehend.

      1.5.6.9. Pro:
      The thinking man must oppose all cruel customs no matter how deeply rooted in tradition and surrounded by a halo. When we have a choice, we must avoid bringing torment and injury into the life of another, even the lowliest creature; to do so is to renounce our manhood and shoulder a guilt which nothing justifies. - Albert Schweitzer

      1.5.6.10. Pro:
      Love for fellow Earthlings would include the notion that our lives are precious and, therefore, we are not something to be eaten.

      1.5.6.11. Pro:
      Eating someone or parts of someone is contradictory to compassion. Compassion involves the understanding of suffering and its reduction as much as possible. It is unlikely that there is not any suffering associated with the steps involved in eating a living being.

    1.5.7. Con:
    Morality is subjective, so eating meat is not necessarily immoral.

      1.5.7.1. Pro:
      Humans subjectively determine what has moral value, and the majority of humans place significantly less moral value on the lives of farm animals than the incomes and pleasure of humans.

        1.5.7.1.1. Con:
        Moral relativism is a weak standard of morality, with no true consideration of why things are wrong, it is only an example of stage 4 of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development [733]. We need a better reason, a real reason why things are right, or wrong, like overall happiness, [734] rights, [735]or good will. [736]

          1.5.7.1.1.1. Con:
          This position assumes out of hand that some things are definitively wrong. Yes, a strong moral system gives us a tool for "objectively" decrying actions that we disagree with, but saying that moral relativism is a weak standard doesn't affect whether or not it is real.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.1. Con:
            We are a part of reality, and thereby can shape it to an extent. If we choose to enforce certain standards, they are "real" to an extent as they have force on our interactions with physical reality, and thereby effects on physical reality.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.2. Con:
            By moral relativism's own measure, it is not real, but an opinion one has with no grounding, or weight.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.3. Con:
            If one uses a what they feel is right to determine their moral system instead of using their moral system to determine what is right, they are by no measure using a moral system.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.4. Con:
            If moral relativism is true, everything is permissible, full stop.

              1.5.7.1.1.1.4.1. Con:
              Moral relativism claims that moral standards are relevant to a person's culture and context. This does not mean that everything is permissible, since moral standards still exist, they are simply not the same for everyone.

                1.5.7.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
                But it allows for the existence of other cultures, and it is conceivable that things in other cultures are not wrong, so there is no bases by which one could object to any action. All actions must be found to be permissible.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.5. Con:
            This assumes out of hand that nothing is definitely wrong.

            1.5.7.1.1.1.6. Con:
            We've seen morality in it's effect on the world, and we've seen the same moral concepts pop up independently in all corners of the world. Morality exists, and there is good reason to believe it is objective.

              1.5.7.1.1.1.6.1. Pro:
              Almost any human would agree that, for example, torturing infants for fun is immoral. The fact that there is disagreement on more complex moral issues does not imply that there is no capacity for universal agreement on moral facts.

        1.5.7.1.2. Con:
        Humans subjectively determine what has moral value for humans. It is possible and probable other animals with social structures have their own sense of morality. Several animals have shown that they understand what is fair and not fair, including chimpanzees [737], crows [738], and dogs. Capuchin monkeys [739] have rejected rewards when they saw them as unfair or unequal to rewards given to their peers. Surely a recognition of fairness equates a type of morality. Humans are not the sole arbiters of moral value.

        1.5.7.1.3. Con:
        Animals have preferences, as frequently demonstrated through their actions, so under preference utilitarianism their demonstrated preferences should be taken into account.

          1.5.7.1.3.1. Con:
          Taking into account preferences of different animals and trying to please all of them will eventually fail. Humans might have higher moral standards than other animals but humans still are animals that have preferences.

        1.5.7.1.4. Con:
        Humans do not subjectively determine what has moral value. For example, humans could not subjectively determine that some races have fewer rights than others.

          1.5.7.1.4.1. Con:
          Humans can determine whatever they want, just look back in history. The apartheid regime of South Africa or the Nazi German concentration camps. Or even further back to the time of the Roman Empire.

            1.5.7.1.4.1.1. Con:
            Each of those historical instances eventually fell apart by intervention from other countries to disrupt their immorality. Thus humans do clearly (eventually) determine and enforce subjective moral norms.

        1.5.7.1.5. Con:
        Majorities are not always correct, and the original subject of "humans should stop eating meat" is prescriptive, i.e., discussing what we should start doing rather than what we are. Potentially changing societal opinions and perspectives is well within the scope of this debate.

      1.5.7.2. Con:
      -> See 1.5.7.1.1.

      1.5.7.3. Pro:
      Morality only applies to humans. Morality functions to allow people to live together and cooperate in social groups. Morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world.

        1.5.7.3.1. Con:
        Humans are the only species on our planet with the power of sophisticated ethical reasoning. It is because of this that we can be bound by morality, which can include prescriptions about how we should or should not act on our environment and other beings in that environment.

        1.5.7.3.2. Con:
        Humans are part of the natural world. If morality is an irrelevant concept in the context of the natural world, it follows that morality must be irrelevant in the context of humans. But the author states that morality applies to humans. This is a contradiction, and therefore the claim taken as a whole is logically invalid.

          1.5.7.3.2.1. Con:
          This argument is based on the assumption that there is only one meaning to the word "natural", whereas there clearly are at least two: natural as in encompassing the entire universe, and natural as opposed to artificial or anything derived from human thought and action.

        1.5.7.3.3. Con:
        We already apply moral concepts to non-human animals in most societies. Forms of animal cruelty are illegal in many countries, showing that we can intuitively and practically apply moral reasoning to non-human animals.

        1.5.7.3.4. Con:
        The philosophy of non-consumption of animals IS a human moral construct asserting itself onto human beings.  Vegetarianism isn't being applied to the animals. Animals are not being held to moral standards; we are.

        1.5.7.3.5. Pro:
        Good morality and excercise of care is essential to keep both the human mind and the ecosystem in a healthy state, while ignorance will only lead to endless self inflicted suffering. Animals are not held under the same moral standards as human beings.

        1.5.7.3.6. Con:
        The problem with your argument is that many people don't actually contribute to society... Are we allowed then to experiment on them(mentally handicapped, children...)?

          1.5.7.3.6.1. Con:
          There's a difference between contribution and cooperation.

        1.5.7.3.7. Con:
        If being right means being beneficial to human species, then moral goodness is a merely “objective” property (in principle measurable) about the physical effects of something. But moral statements are not merely descriptive. People may disagree morally without disagreeing about any facts about the physical world and its laws.

        1.5.7.3.8. Con:
        If morality served only to allow people to live together and co-operate then all kinds of wrongs would be morally permissible. People can live together and co-operate in a society that allows slavery, forced child marriage, brutal excessive punishments or female genital mutilation, for example.

          1.5.7.3.8.1. Con:
          Child marriage, corporal punishment, and genital mutilation are all injustices perpetrated against human beings, therefore this is not incongruous with the claim that morality only applies to human beings.

        1.5.7.3.9. Pro:
        Morality is a subjective standard, and relative only to the standard which has been agreed is moral. "Right" and "wrong" cannot be debated objectively.

      1.5.7.4. Pro:
      It is cruel, but morality is a very relative concept. In the perspective of the animal kingdom, we are part of the omnivore group, and eating meat is what our species do, as many many others. Applying morality to nature is pointless, many other species cause harm to many others. Applying the term morality to meat eating is pointless and counterproductive to the actual goal: to reduce harm to some animals.

        1.5.7.4.1. Con:
        The very first human societies were naturally gathered tribes, so applying morality to nature is not pointless - it is in fact a significant part of how humans became and continue to be what we are today, as moral constraints to our natural state formed a significant part of shaping modern society and the modern quality of life we enjoy. They can similarly help to improve animals' quality of life.

        1.5.7.4.2. Pro:
        The illusion of being more than nature or above nature is created by actual society. The detachment from simple things as finding our own food make us believe we are not animals but the biology says otherwise.

      1.5.7.5. Con:
      -> See 1.5.7.1.3.

      1.5.7.6. Pro:
      Moral arguments are often subjective. The comparative harm of eating say, an oyster, versus a higher plant which may, according to studies have a central nervious system depends on philosophical assumptions that are unprovable, such as that plants do not feel, or the degree to which animals feel.

        1.5.7.6.1. Con:
        Bivalves are marginal cases which aren't really relevant to the majority of animal agriculture.  It's readily provable that a pig can feel pain and suffering in a way that a carrot cannot.

      1.5.7.7. Con:
      -> See 1.5.7.1.4.

      1.5.7.8. Con:
      Finding morality in consulting ones own or wider society's values is necessarily subjective. Consulting reason however leads to deontological ethical truths free from subjectivity.

      1.5.7.9. Pro:
      Morality apply to things we chose to apply it to. For example, some humans chose to treat other humans less morally, such as criminals or simply a person they don't like based on their ideology, therefore, it is normal for humans to be "cruel and immoral" selectively, including to animals.

    1.5.8. Pro:
    -> See 1.2.15.3.1.3.

    1.5.9. Con:
    Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.

      1.5.9.1. Con:
      This depends on the assumptions that a) all humans act on this ethical imperative to cease meat consumption completely b) that their replacement is necessary or intrinsically good and c) that these animals are not replaced without being the source of meat such as due to ecosystem-integrity motivated work or due to introduction of certain wild species.

      1.5.9.2. Pro:
      Animals are meant to exist as part of a food chain. If we, the apex predators, simply stopped consuming meat thousands of species (cows, sheep, pigs etc..) would become extinct as they only exist due to their value as food, due to selective breeding. This would invariably destabilise countless ecosystems.

        1.5.9.2.1. Con:
        Large-scale farming also destabilizes, if not outright ruins and supplants, countless ecosystems.

        1.5.9.2.2. Pro:
        Eating meat is also in some case a way to preserve species created by humans, and which can not survive without us. Such as in France: béarnaise, pie noire bretonne.

          1.5.9.2.2.1. Con:
          Yes but as a delicacy. We don't need to breed 'this many' in order to preserve the species.

        1.5.9.2.3. Con:
        "Animals are meant to exist as part of a food chain" This is just an appeal to nature fallacy. That animals exist as a part of a food chain typically in nature isn't relevant to whether it's moral to eat meat.

      1.5.9.3. Con:
      Even if there was a one-off slaughter of all of those livestock, it is still a preferable outcome from the perspective of animal welfare to prevent the enslavement of untold future generations of animals.

      1.5.9.4. Con:
      The quantity of animals that exist is less important than having each animal posses a good quality of life free of suffering.

      1.5.9.5. Pro:
      Veganism is endangering animals. Diversity of all kinds is worth preserving. Without demand for animal products the majority of domesticated animal breeds would become extinct. Cows do not exist in the wild, they exist within the framework of supply and demand. Just because animal diversity was created by humans doesn't make it less valuable than natural diversity. Treat animals well within the supply and demand structure. Don't prevent them being born by removing the need for them.

        1.5.9.5.1. Con:
        Bringing animals into existences which will bring them only suffering is cruel and immoral.

        1.5.9.5.2. Con:
        It's highly unlikely that cows or other farm animals would become extinct under a vegan system, even if their numbers would be greatly reduced.

        1.5.9.5.3. Con:
        Some domestic animals are induced to produce more than what they would do naturally.

        1.5.9.5.4. Con:
        -> See 1.1.2.17.

      1.5.9.6. Pro:
      Current farming practices prevent certain species from going extinct. Animals bred on farms have been selectively bred for centuries, resulting in genetically imprinted tendencies. Many widely farmed species are incapable of surviving in the wild. With many species being sustained solely to provide nutritional purpose, veganism would effectively disincentivise the further preservation of these species. Notably, cattle, chickens, and sheep come to mind.

        1.5.9.6.1. Con:
        Preservation of species may not be more important than avoiding condemning (members of) said species to ongoing and indefinite suffering.

      1.5.9.7. Pro:
      The habitat, well being, and continued survival of a majority of domestic livestock is directly dependent upon human consumption of meat.

        1.5.9.7.1. Con:
        Factory farms are hardly a natural "habitat" for the animals which endure them, nor are such lives exactly conductive to their wellbeing. Survival is the only thing current farming practices offer them, and it is a very disturbing form thereof.

      1.5.9.8. Con:
      All farmed animals are artificially inseminated more times a year than it is natural. So left alone, farm animals will become half in number after the first generation dies.

      1.5.9.9. Con:
      All farm animals have natural predators, which means that, left in the wild, around a third of them will be eaten.

      1.5.9.10. Con:
      This claim implies that what effectively amounts to an unnatural overpopulation of farm animals is desirable.

      1.5.9.11. Con:
      It would be ethically permissible to allow these excess animals to live pleasant lives and die of old age without being replaced. The moral objective is not to maintain a certain quantity of farm animals, rather to maintain an acceptable quality of life for all animals wherever possible, and avoid actively wronging them.

    1.5.10. Con:
    A great many human activities cause the deaths of animals. A focus on meat leads to moral inconsistency and potential hypocrisy.

      1.5.10.1. Con:
      This is a straw man fallacy. We should limit all activities causing animal suffering.

      1.5.10.2. Pro:
      Construction, manufacture, driving and aviation are some examples of human practices which cause the deaths of many animals. Vegetarians and vegans participate in these practices.

        1.5.10.2.1. Con:
        Some vegetarians and vegans do follow harm-minimization practices in other areas of their life as well, as much as reasonably possible given the current state of society.

      1.5.10.3. Con:
      There is a difference between intentional and premeditated deaths, and incidental ones.

      1.5.10.4. Pro:
      The large part of foods have in some way animal origin intakes. That includes the sugars, some of them, the exaustion and death of bees for the production of japan almonds. It's almost impossible to prevent eating moving life, the only way is to certificate, under some sort of paid authority.

      1.5.10.5. Con:
      Humans fail their moral obligations in many ways, and eating meat could be considered to be one of them.

      1.5.10.6. Pro:
      If we stop eating meat, the consumption of dairy-product proteins will increase, and the dairy industry will grow. Dairy farming is even worse for animal welfare than the meat industry, because the animals suffer for longer.

        1.5.10.6.1. Con:
        A vegan diet does not require a dairy (or egg) industry.

        1.5.10.6.2. Pro:
        Dairy also requires frequent breeding of cattle to keep the female in milk. Half of these calves (the bulls) will not be suitable for dairy production and will have to be slaughtered.

      1.5.10.7. Con:
      A great many human activities cause the deaths of animals, but focusing on one of those activities will still lower the overall negative impact on animals. Moral inconsistency itself has no negative moral value.

    1.5.11. Pro:
    -> See 1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.

    1.5.12. Con:
    Eating meat is not immoral; the production of meat can be cruel but the consumption is not.

      1.5.12.1. Con:
      The pressures of supply and demand drive meat production. If you consume meat you are driving up the demand for meat, which increases production and all the attendant suffering related to it.

        1.5.12.1.1. Pro:
        If the production of meat can be cruel but the consumption is not necessarily, the consumer would need to take adequate measures to ensure the consumption is ethical. Such measures could be only buying meat products that meet certain animal welfare standards and supporting specific policy proposals that would raise animal welfare.

        1.5.12.1.2. Con:
        Consuming meat increases its production, but it is not consumers who determine the conditions of production and thereby cause potential suffering, but the producers.

          1.5.12.1.2.1. Con:
          This sidesteps the point. The production causes the suffering, and the consumers cause the production; therefore, the consumers indirectly cause the suffering.

          1.5.12.1.2.2. Con:
          By this argument, consuming any product produced under harmful conditions (e.g., by human slaves) is acceptable since only producers are directly responsible.

            1.5.12.1.2.2.1. Con:
            People do not necessarily know 100% of the process, which applies to not just the ranches, but also farms, hence they're not obliged to feel burdened. Organic vegetables can be grown by producers who failed to pay their workers in a timely manner just the same.

      1.5.12.2. Pro:
      All human consumption implies the destruction of something. All food systems are morally debatable.

        1.5.12.2.1. Con:
        That all food systems are morally debatable does not mean that the respective treatment of animals is not immoral.

        1.5.12.2.2. Con:
        That all human consumption implies the destruction of something is false, especially when also considering the net effects. Wood can be produced as a renewable resource in sustainable ways.

        1.5.12.2.3. Con:
        The claim is not about destruction but about cruelty and suffering.

        1.5.12.2.4. Con:
        This is an oversimplification. It's clearly possible for some food systems to be significantly morally better than others, and we should strive for the best. Accepting this claim would enable all sorts of consumption which most people would find abhorrent.

    1.5.13. Con:
    Given that meat is still the primary food source for many people in less fortunate countries. Given that human bodies vary wildly in which foods they will process more efficiently. Given that some conditions will actually make eating plant only foods a negative life choice for many. It is cruel and immoral to presume that no human should eat meat under any circumstances. The above claim completely ignores the quality of life of other humans, making the claim itself cruel and immoral.

    1.5.14. Con:
    Consuming vegetables is also cruel to both the plants and to the workers responsible for the agricultural process.

      1.5.14.1. Pro:
      If eating meat is immoral because animals feel pain, then eating plants may also be immoral. Scientists have been applying the strategies of animal behavior research to plants and finding that plants share many of the characteristics of animals - including an awareness of their environment, of injury (pain), memory (non-genetic), and the ability to communicate. If consuming beings that feel pain is immoral, and both plants and animals feel pain, where does that leave us?[1] [740][2] [741]

        1.5.14.1.1. Con:
        The sources linked here are extremely tenuous. For scientific claims such as these, journalistic sources are simply insufficient, and scientific literature should be cited.

        1.5.14.1.2. Con:
        -> See 1.5.3.6.

        1.5.14.1.3. Con:
        Plants do not have a brain, so do not have a consciousness

          1.5.14.1.3.1. Pro:
          Pain is understood to be a function of the brain and nervous system, which plants do not have.

          1.5.14.1.3.2. Con:
          Consciousness does not necessarily require the presence of a brain as there is no scientific peer-reviewed literature heavily supporting this hypothesis. Nor is there any direct evidence of the nature of consciousness, or how one might determine it. The idea that plants are without "intelligence" is a topic that has recently become highly controversial in the academic world. [1] [742]

            1.5.14.1.3.2.1. Con:
            There is no peer-reviewed literature regarding consciousness outside of a brain, either.  There is much peer-reviewed literature on consciousness, always requiring a complex system of sensory processing that can at this time only be found within a brain.en.wikipedia.org [743]

            1.5.14.1.3.2.2. Con:
            The statement is not at all represented in the source. Plants do not have a conscience.

        1.5.14.1.4. Con:
        The amount of consciousness that a plant could potentially have is nothing in comparison to the amount of consciousness had by animals

          1.5.14.1.4.1. Con:
          If eating plants is justified, as the amount of consciousness a plant could potentially have is nothing compared to that of animals, there is no problem with eating meat, as the amount of consciousness they could potentially have is nothing compared to that of humans.

          1.5.14.1.4.2. Con:
          If you accept consciousness as the defining factor, and also that consciousness lies along a continuum on which humans, animals, and plants lie (as your argument suggests), then the threshold on that continuum beyond which plants or animals become protected is arbitrary, and could just as easily be extended to plants as animals.  Currently, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that plants and animals experience consciousness the way humans do.

        1.5.14.1.5. Con:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.14.5.1.

        1.5.14.1.6. Con:
        The feeling of pain is produced by the nervous system. Plants do not have a nervous system so it is very unlikely that they could feel emotions at all.

          1.5.14.1.6.1. Con:
          We already know that they do react to many stimuli, as do bacteria too, to be fair. Maybe systems analogous to the nervous system could be associated with some kind or level of pain. newyorker.com [744]

            1.5.14.1.6.1.1. Con:
            My iPhone also reacts to stimuli. It doesn't mean it feels pain.

              1.5.14.1.6.1.1.1. Con:
              iPhones are not a living being.

                1.5.14.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                iPhones do not have the capability to reproduce.

        1.5.14.1.7. Pro:
        Killing an animal without causing suffering is equal to killing a plant. Both have the right to live.

          1.5.14.1.7.1. Con:
          Domestic animals raised for meat would not exist except for that production chain which we are responsible for. Therefore, we are responsible for every moment of suffering during their life, not just at the moment of death.

          1.5.14.1.7.2. Con:
          To argue that killing plants is equal to killing animals would enable the argument that cutting the lawn is worse than killing 80 kittens.

            1.5.14.1.7.2.1. Con:
            Not so. Cutting the lawn is not killing any being under normal circumstances. Plants exist in a materially different way than animals do, and grass is not killed when it is trimmed, it simply regrows.

          1.5.14.1.7.3. Pro:
          The end of a life is the end of a life. Cutting a lawn does not kill the grass; it makes a lawn healthier. But killing a plant is equal in scope to killing an animal. Each has the same right to life. As do human beings.

        1.5.14.1.8. Con:
        Plants never felt and never will feel pain. It is true, that they might have a basic awareness of their surrounding and can react to stimulis, but plants all in all lack a brain and a nervous system. Whereas animals clearly express their pain by screaming, running away etc. Plants can not react this way.This fact suggest that they are not experiencing pain. It would be straight up cruel, if nature would have ''given'' plants the ability to feel pain, since they cant move and avoid it.

        1.5.14.1.9. Con:
        The fact that plants *might* feel pain does not justify causing definite pain to animals.

          1.5.14.1.9.1. Pro:
          In situations of uncertainty, it is often best to go with the highest probability of a good outcome, or minimize the known/likeliest losses (in this case, 100% chance of pain/death for animals if animals eaten, ??% chance of pain/death for plants if plants eaten).

        1.5.14.1.10. Con:
        It's not simply pain but also suffering. There's no good evidence that plants are conscious so they cannot suffer in any meaningful way, even if they can react to a stimulus which could be called 'pain'.

          1.5.14.1.10.1. Con:
          Pain in and of itself is worth taking into account.

            1.5.14.1.10.1.1. Con:
            But it isn't pain in any meaningful sense if a plant isn't conscious, it's simply a reaction to a stimulus.

              1.5.14.1.10.1.1.1. Con:
              One could argue that anything is "merely a reaction to stimulus".

        1.5.14.1.11. Con:
        The focus should be on minimizing suffering. Humans cannot survive without eating and it seems apparent that if plants suffer, they suffer less and qualitatively differently.

        1.5.14.1.12. Con:
        Plants are the bottom of the food chain. Nothing higher up the food chain can survive without plants being eaten. Humans cannot survive without plants in their food chain.

        1.5.14.1.13. Pro:
        Science might not be yet aware of the full spectrum of flora "feeling". We might, however, one day discover (and are in the process of) that they suffer and feel just like humans and other beings.

        1.5.14.1.14. Pro:
        The alternative to eating meat on ethical grounds is eating plant based material. Plants, though, are life forms too. There is no alternative in which one eats inorganic matter or avoids killing. It is arbitrary and reductive to state that human life matters, and less complex animal life matters, but still less complex plant life does not. Consuming other species is inherent to human existence; It is naive to congratulate oneself on only killing and consuming a certain variety of life.

      1.5.14.2. Pro:
      It is cruel and immoral to eat fruits and vegetables that have been picked by forced labor, child labor, brutal sexual abuse, or other cruel and inhumane conditions. For the majority of the fruit- and vegetable-buying population, this is unavoidable, so therefore, eating meat is no more cruelty-free than eating vegetables: www.pbs.org [745], www.ilo.org [746], 
      www.hrw.org [747], www.pri.org [748]

        1.5.14.2.1. Con:
        That is a false dilemma and so is the conclusion. However, your claim about working conditions are probably correct in many cases. But when looking at what it takes to decrease suffering for laborers (eg increase wages, rights to organize, improving working conditions) versus for animals (e.g. stop eating industrially produced meat and only eat free grazing / wild game) it is clear that abstaining from eating meat is the more reasonable and sustainable action.

          1.5.14.2.1.1. Con:
          This is to suggest that reducing animal suffering is more important than reducing human suffering. Morality demands that the life of the enslaved vegetable farmer is of more value than the life of a farmed chicken.

      1.5.14.3. Pro:
      Time is relative for each living thing. Plants/trees live for 100s of years, they just don't feel the same amount of pain as animals do because of their slow growth. However, you're still hurting them. For example, think of us as trees and mosquitoes as humans.

      1.5.14.4. Pro:
      Increased farming to produce more plant foods will result in an increase in the amount human exploitation in countries where work regulations and workers rights are poor. Perhaps these concerns should be addressed first?

      1.5.14.5. Con:
      We don't eat other humans. Why? Because we're so similar to them, so we feel strong empathy. Animals share much of the same DNA, biology and even emotions as humans, so we feel strong empathy for them as well. Plants, however, are from a separate biological kingdom, and work very differently from both humans and animals. Although we do have to eat some organic food to survive, we can choose the source that causes the least suffering from our human perspective.

      1.5.14.6. Con:
      Workers can suffer in both plant and animal agriculture, so this not an argument for or against either of them.

      1.5.14.7. Con:
      Eating botanical fruit from plants is not damaging to the plant in any way, so it is not cruel. Some vegetables are actually, in the botanical sense, fruit. Conversely, eating root vegetables, for example, is damaging to the plant. But since plants are not biologically designed to feel pain, it is not cruel to eat them.

      1.5.14.8. Con:
      Assuming this was true, consuming meat indirectly consumes vast amounts of plants that are used as animal feed. Eating meat means indirectly contributing to the death of both plants and animals, not animals instead of plants.

      1.5.14.9. Con:
      Cruelty suggests suffering. As plants lack any sensory system, and by observation take longer to die, it is perhaps safer to assume that less suffering means less pain. As plants do not experience physical pain, such a claim is moot.

    1.5.15. Con:
    If everyone who cares about the ethical treatment of animals were to stop eating meat, then the only people farming and consuming meat would be those who lack compassion for the animals. Human's relationship with nature should be one of mutual respect and compassion - this will never happen if those who would put this in practice choose instead to have no symbiotic relationship with nature at all.

    1.5.16. Con:
    Since meat eating is in human nature, it cannot be immoral.

      1.5.16.1. Pro:
      Just like other animals, it is simply part of the food chain for us to eat meat.

      1.5.16.2. Pro:
      Every organism on earth dies or is killed at some point, so other organisms can live. This is how nature works.

        1.5.16.2.1. Pro:
        All living beings kill — either plant life or animal life — to survive. Even as a vegetarian, you're supporting the deaths of animals that lose habitat to farming, are killed for pest control, etc. The question isn't whether or not to kill--it's how to do so humanely.

          1.5.16.2.1.1. Con:
          Plants tend not to need to kill to survive.

          1.5.16.2.1.2. Con:
          Scavengers eat dead or decaying things they find, but don't kill them.

          1.5.16.2.1.3. Con:
          Some living beings survive off mineral deposits.

          1.5.16.2.1.4. Con:
          This is true but the killing ,and more importantly, the growing and raising of live stock is not done humanely.

          1.5.16.2.1.5. Con:
          As a vegetarian, one strives to reduce suffering. It is impossible to eliminate it. And there is a difference between supporting the deaths of animals and unintentionally causing them.

            1.5.16.2.1.5.1. Pro:
            Much more agricultural land is needed to produce meat than plant foods. Approximately 75% of soy crops are used for animal feed [749]

          1.5.16.2.1.6. Con:
          Give an animal a good life, and you cannot humanely kill it since it does not want to die. The only way to kill an animal humanely is to do it when it is living a life of pain, but if you are intentionally adding pain in the first place then you've already lost the opportunity to be humane.

        1.5.16.2.2. Con:
        It is natural for organisms to die so others can live. It is not natural for these organisms to be exploited, mass produced and fed growth hormones.

          1.5.16.2.2.1. Con:
          Humans are a result of nature, so everything they do is natural.

            1.5.16.2.2.1.1. Con:
            Various lines could be drawn as to where and why a human action stops being "natural".

              1.5.16.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
              However, this runs the risk of creating a culture police which condemns anything "unnatural" regardless of benefits while lauding "natural" actions and putting them beyond reproach, ultimately enforcing a specific vision of "nature".

              1.5.16.2.2.1.1.2. Con:
              Any line between what is 'natural' and 'unnatural' is by its nature arbitrary.

            1.5.16.2.2.1.2. Con:
            If this were true and the proposition that natural things are morally permissible were true, then everything would be permissible. This is clearly false.

              1.5.16.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
              It has not been determined that natural things are morally permissible.

          1.5.16.2.2.2. Pro:
          Humans are the only creature on earth to have such a huge impact on the environment in such a short space of time. This shift is known as the anthropocene [750], arguably the most notable disruption of natural systems the earth has seen, caused by a single species.

          1.5.16.2.2.3. Con:
          It might be the case that we ought to stop factory farming techniques, but this does not imply that we ought to stop eating meat entirely.

        1.5.16.2.3. Con:
        Nature is amoral. Humans are not.

          1.5.16.2.3.1. Pro:
          Humans are reflective creatures with the capacity to grasp complex reasons for and against certain actions. This gives them the ability to understand morality and moral reasons.

          1.5.16.2.3.2. Pro:
          Nature is a collection of descriptive facts. Facts are not normative in any way; to attempt to derive a normative statement from purely factual premises is the is-ought gap [751].

        1.5.16.2.4. Pro:
        If one day, humans disappear from earth, prey animals will be still eaten by other predators. Nature set up a system where some animals eat others. Humans are not a different creature, we only has a different weapon (intelligence) than other predators. Humans have no influence on nature's law; it is a system that was here long ago before humans even existed on this earth.

        1.5.16.2.5. Pro:
        If we didn't eat animals, their equivalents in the wilds would still be eaten by other predators, so as long as we give our animals living conditions and deaths that aren't worse/less humane than ones in the wild, eating them makes no difference, morally speaking.
        
        Therefore, we should instead focus on improving the living conditions of animals and making their deaths as humane as possible. This is a far more realistic goal to focus on, compared to trying to prevent humanity from consuming meat.

        1.5.16.2.6. Con:
        This argument negates all contributions made by medicine.

        1.5.16.2.7. Con:
        Nature is quite specific about which animals routinely kill and eat others and which do not. A human without technology or fire would largely be unable to kill, butcher or eat anything other than perhaps a few bugs with their physical equipment. They lack sharp teeth and claws for ripping flesh and/or catching prey and a low enough stomach pH for safely digesting raw meat. Just like the other great apes, humans are physically adapted to consuming a predominantly plant based diet after weaning.

        1.5.16.2.8. Con:
        -> See 1.5.4.15.1.6.1.

        1.5.16.2.9. Pro:
        Animals sometimes die out when a new predator interrupts a natural balance. Thus hunting animals to extinction is a natural process.

          1.5.16.2.9.1. Pro:
          The Reunion Pigeon [752] became extinct after the introduction of cats in 1674.

          1.5.16.2.9.2. Pro:
          The Red Rail [753] bird became extinct through introduced cats.

          1.5.16.2.9.3. Pro:
          The Giant Galliwasp [754] became extinct by mongooses.

      1.5.16.3. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.4.15.1.

      1.5.16.4. Con:
      There is nothing natural about factory farming and caging, controlling, and herding "prey" animals on a day to day basis. This cannot be argued to be treating said "prey" animals "according to their natures".

        1.5.16.4.1. Con:
        The methods by which prey animals are killed vary from predator to predator. It may be natural for humans to use technology to kill prey animals.

        1.5.16.4.2. Con:
        -> See 1.5.16.2.2.3.

        1.5.16.4.3. Con:
        Any achievement of humanity was ultimately the product of their evolutionary path; every human action is "natural".

        1.5.16.4.4. Pro:
        The vast majority of animals are bred artificially, separated from their families and raised in a completely artificial and confined manner. No element of their life is natural. This is what differentiates it from nature.

      1.5.16.5. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.4.9.6.

      1.5.16.6. Pro:
      Morality is best described as an ideal way "to be." This coincides with natural law. The most basic natural law seems to be that a system must adapt to subjugate other less-adapted systems (eat or be eaten). All moral systems are subservient to this basic universal morality. Thinking we may or should transcend that construct, when we are, ourselves, products of it, reeks of hubris.

        1.5.16.6.1. Con:
        There is no reason to believe that morality instructs us to remain exactly as we are originally. Rather, morality should be aspirational; it should tell us how we ought to live, not how we originally lived.

      1.5.16.7. Con:
      As humans are animals the logical extension of this is that humans should be allowed to kill each other without consequences. Clearly we have progressed beyond such fatalism.

        1.5.16.7.1. Con:
        Animals that form communities usually cooperate without killing each other, and humans are such animals. It is natural for humans not to kill each other.

      1.5.16.8. Con:
      Humans, as the dominant species on Earth, have transcended the natural order in countless ways. We are no longer required to kill to survive and so have no excuse for not taking on higher moral obligations.

        1.5.16.8.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.3.9.3.1.2.1.1.2.1.

        1.5.16.8.2. Pro:
        What is "natural" is specifically that animals eat other animals for survival. Eating other animals for pleasure is not natural.

        1.5.16.8.3. Con:
        The fact that we transcend the natural order in many ways does not make us obligated to deviate from our natural behaviours. If I like eating meat and it is a natural thing for a human being, there is no immorality in eating it.

          1.5.16.8.3.1. Con:
          If we are no longer required to kill to survive, and your choice of eating meat inflicts harm and suffering on animals then your choice is immoral, because what is moral cannot be judged only by what is "natural" but by what is necessary.

          1.5.16.8.3.2. Con:
          As a species, humans can naturally evolve, in time, from omnivore to herbivore. Many humans eat only plant-based foods without any health repercussions and so it is possible.

            1.5.16.8.3.2.1. Con:
            The fact that they can evolve does not make them have to evolve in that direction.

          1.5.16.8.3.3. Con:
          Eating meat involves two living beings: the eater and the eaten. The eaten has to either be killed or eaten alive. These are moral issues.

            1.5.16.8.3.3.1. Con:
            -> See 1.3.9.3.1.1.

        1.5.16.8.4. Pro:
        It is not very civilized of humans to adapt the same meat-eating habits as wild beasts in nature.

        1.5.16.8.5. Pro:
        Part of the evolution of humans is to develop increased empathy for other species. We cannot advance as a species until we accept that we are no different than any other animal, and accept our place in the animal kingdom. When we embrace each other as earthlings or universal beings, as opposed to humans/vs animals, only then can we escape the trap of the speciesist mindset.

        1.5.16.8.6. Pro:
        We still need to eat to live. Things we eat die. Therefore, we still need to have things die for us to live.

      1.5.16.9. Con:
      Many natural things, like murder, rape, or leaving offspring to die are deeply immoral. The consumption of meat is immoral on similar grounds.

        1.5.16.9.1. Con:
        Murder or rape are not natural. When an animal kills a prey, it is not murder, it is hunting. Also, rape is not a thing among animals, as there is no consent among them.

          1.5.16.9.1.1. Con:
          If there is no consent among them, it is always rape.

        1.5.16.9.2. Pro:
        To claim the natural order of the world is the ethical ideal, is an appeal to violence and dominance as a form of moral order. This is the basis for the old arguments in support of slavery and genocide; hardly a fit for the 21st century.

      1.5.16.10. Pro:
      If we are concerned about the death and harm of animals the logical extension of this care is to do as much as possible to prevent animals from dying in the wild. That we don't do so supports the idea we accept that this natural dynamic of predator-prey is not always overridden by animal welfare concerns.

        1.5.16.10.1. Pro:
        Many animals are killed and consumed by predators every day. The only difference is that humans do not perceive sadness when those animals suffer and are killed in the wild. It is actually the individual's perception that an animal is suffering (when a human butchers it) that causes him/her to feel pity, and not the fact that animals are suffering (which happens all the time, everywhere).

          1.5.16.10.1.1. Con:
          Similar remarks apply to the killing of humans by predators. Yet killing humans is clearly immoral.

            1.5.16.10.1.1.1. Con:
            Humans killing humans is immoral, but predators killing humans is merely unfortunate as they don't have moral agency like we do. Since predators have no moral agency, killing them is not immoral. Since animals we use have no moral agency, killing them is not immoral.

          1.5.16.10.1.2. Con:
          It's not about "perception" of animal suffering. The animals are suffering. The animals feel physical pain just as much as humans do. If a car ran over your dog you would empathize with your dog's physical pain. Cows, dogs and humans are all mammals and all feel pain. People just don't want to think about they pain that they are causing by paying farmers to kill animals.

            1.5.16.10.1.2.1. Pro:
            Animals observably respond to pain and suffering - they flee when possible, and whimper or otherwise vocalise distress (or respond with frenzied behaviour) to sources of suffering which are not readily escapable.

        1.5.16.10.2. Con:
        Most people intuitively make a sharp distinction between the deaths of animals in the wild and the deaths of animals in farms, which suggests that they do not treat farms as simply another instance of the predator-prey dynamic.

        1.5.16.10.3. Con:
        That we ought to eliminate both the suffering of wild animals and the suffering of farm animals is a natural consequence of the idea that animals are morally important. It is not a conclusion that we should avoid.

        1.5.16.10.4. Pro:
        It is plausible to believe [755] that most natural habitats are, on net, bad for animal wellbeing. If we cared overridingly about animal welfare, then we ought to destroy those habitats. The fact that we reject this indicates that animal welfare is not the overriding consideration, and that there is intrinsic value associated with the operation of natural habitats.

        1.5.16.10.5. Con:
        Humans are concerned about being responsible for the death of animals, so the question "Is eating meat wrong?" is about humans eating meat and being responsible for the caused harm, and not about non-human animals eating meat.

        1.5.16.10.6. Con:
        There is some concern for the welfare of animals in the wild [756], although the movement is probably not as large as it should be.

          1.5.16.10.6.1. Pro:
          Many people are opposed to human-related hunting, trapping and fishing. This indicates a concern for the welfare of animals in the wild.

        1.5.16.10.7. Con:
        Humans have made improvements to nonhuman animals' habitats for welfare reasons. Examples of this are the provision of water [757] during droughts to prevent dehydration related suffering and deaths and the construction of crossings [758] over or under busy roads to prevent accident related injuries and deaths. The planting of biome-appropriate, food-producing plants to alleviate hunger might also be considered.

        1.5.16.10.8. Pro:
        If the suffering of the eaten animal is what makes eating meat immoral, humans have as much right to meat or lack thereof than other meat-eating animals. Creating a world without animal consumption would make entire ecosystems dependent on the human existence and good will.

        1.5.16.10.9. Pro:
        Extreme forms of suffering like starvation, dehydration, or being eaten alive by a predator are much more common in wild animals than farm animals. If non-existence is a better alternative, we should be at least as concerned with animals under nature's "care"; potentially sterilizing or deliberately destroying wild animal habitats. (See Journal of Practical Ethics [759])

        1.5.16.10.10. Pro:
        "Extreme forms of suffering like starvation, dehydration, or being eaten alive by a predator are much more common in wild animals than farm animals. Crocodiles and hyenas disembowel their prey before killing them (Tomasik 2009). In birds, diseases like avian salmonellosis produce excruciating symptoms in the final days of life, such as depression, shivering, loss of appetite, and just before death, blindness, incoordination, staggering, tremor and convulsions." (Journal of Practical Ethics [760])

        1.5.16.10.11. Pro:
        From a utilitarian perspective, to take farming away likely puts those animals in a state of nature or non-existence. Given nature's cruelty, there's little reason to believe either are better for the animal.

      1.5.16.11. Con:
      It may be natural for reflectively rational creatures like humans to become aware of the consequences of their actions and to abstain from doing things like eating meat.

        1.5.16.11.1. Pro:
        In fact, since humans evolved as the result of natural processes, whatever humans do is, tautologically, natural.

        1.5.16.11.2. Con:
        It is difficult to think of a case where people have to abandon part of their humanity to be moral. People can't have a moral obligation to grow gills or wings.

      1.5.16.12. Pro:
      Nature is much more cruel in the way of animal on animal violence. When humans kill most animals for food it is done in a fast and humane way.

        1.5.16.12.1. Con:
        But the way we rear most animals is not so humane. And often the killing fails and is not so humane.

      1.5.16.13. Con:
      Humankind has exceeded 8 billion individuals in size. this achievement was possible due to unnatural mechanisms. Humankind has not followed the natural order (at least) since the industrial revolution. The concept of morality today is different from the concept of morality in pre-historic times.

        1.5.16.13.1. Con:
        -> See 1.5.16.4.3.

      1.5.16.14. Con:
      If predation is the natural order of the world, then humans should actually predate rather than blindly consuming meat from sources they are not familiar with. Humans desiring to eat meat should go into the wild, kill the wild animal, and then consume it. However, many people are more comfortable with blindly consuming animals whose death they do not have to consider — this is not the 'natural order' at all.

      1.5.16.15. Con:
      Equating "natural" and "not immoral" clearly could be used to justify any activity and status quo, and is a fallacy. Eating meat must be judged not simply on whether it is "natural", but whether it is necessary (in todays advanced society), and in the context (e.g. what is best for humans? for society? for the animals?)

        1.5.16.15.1. Con:
        Reducing our lives to just what is necessary would make it a sad time. Not even animals (as opposed to humans) reduce their living to what is necessary. We eat meat because we find pleasure in it.

      1.5.16.16. Con:
      It may not be immoral to eat other animals, but the fact that having to grow animals to satisfy this need creates environmental issues may make it immoral.

        1.5.16.16.1. Con:
        The argument could also be made about growing vegetables.  If we follow this rabbit hole then we would be scavenging natural resources to the point of greater harm.

      1.5.16.17. Pro:
      -> See 1.5.2.5.3.

      1.5.16.18. Con:
      This isn't just an issue about morality or natural order. This is also an issue about resources, raising animals, fishing and a lot of other related activities consume lots of resources. Population is growing and with the population, the needs of humanity as a whole. The massive amounts of resources needed for meat mass consuption in todays format is an ineficient and irresponsable use of the resources of the planet, which will unavoidibly affect humanity itself as well as the whole planet.

        1.5.16.18.1. Pro:
        It could be regarded as immoral to use the resources of the planet in such an ineficcient and irresponsable way, considering that it might lead to hunger, as it dimishes availability of food for humanity as a whole, and the exhaustation of Earth's environment can as well be regarded as inmoral, as it affects all life on Earth.

      1.5.16.19. Con:
      If eating meat is morally wrong and we are obligated to minimize the meat humans eat, we are also morally obligated to minimize the meat other animals eat.

        1.5.16.19.1. Con:
        Animals don't have a sense of morality so our choices on a diet should not affect theirs.

        1.5.16.19.2. Con:
        Forcing animals to change their diet based on our morals is ethically wrong because our way of thinking is not as advanced/complex as theirs.

    1.5.17. Pro:
    We should not rely on other lives (such as eating animals) to progress our own. Finding a way to not depend on others for people's existence allows for independence. Then people will not feel compelled to resort to cruelty to survive.

    1.5.18. Pro:
    The effects of this cruel treatment are twofold. Not only does it involve the suffering and murder of billions on an annual basis but also negatively impacts the environment (methane and phosphorous outputs, deforestation). Ultimately hurting non-domestic animal species and ourselves in the process

      1.5.18.1. Pro:
      Deontologian ethics support this claim. Since slaughter is ultimately an act of violence, it is certain that someone being mean to animals is more likely to act violently against others.

    1.5.19. Pro:
    Take the flesh that the average meat eater consumes and make them take the action of the rearing and slaughtering of the life form behind that flesh, other than letting a fish suffocate most today would find themselves unable. A wrong they can not replicate if not delegated.

      1.5.19.1. Con:
      This argument isn't leading anywhere. If we used the proposed metric of "deserving something only by doing the difficult task(s) for it", most vegetarians/vegans would have to live from water and fresh air, as they surely wouldn't manage to till a huge farm, containing everything they eat, either.

    1.5.20. Con:
    So many people are worried about animals but don't even think twice when walking by a homeless person on the streets. It's preposterous. How about we worry about our own kind first and then start talking about animals.

      1.5.20.1. Con:
      This implies that caring for animals or caring for people is a binary choice. It isn't. There are those who are well placed and willing to care for people and those who prefer to serve the animal kingdom. As a species we don't just have one idea at a time and follow that to conclusion before we pursue another. It benefits all if humans divide their attentions between various issues and problems we face.

        1.5.20.1.1. Con:
        No one said humans had one idea at a time as a species nor was it implied. It doesn't matter whether one group of people cares for humans and the other devotes to the animal kingdom. This is about individual decisions. If someone cares about another species more than helping out their own then there is a problem.

      1.5.20.2. Con:
      Humans have freedom of choice to some extent, animals subdued by humans don't. The very intention of help urges it to go where is most needed. And so far never was any biggest [761], flagrant and needless cruelty and slaughter as that towards industrial farm animals.

    1.5.21. Con:
    The statement is unclear as it is not specified what the "majority of cases" are. What delineates those from the others, supposedly not cruel or not immoral?

    1.5.22. Con:
    Moral values are typically pertinent to particular individuals, groups, religions or schools of thought. There are no universally accepted moral values that condemn eating meat or treating animals in any particular way. Therefore the statement that eating meat can involve immoral treatment, is false.

      1.5.22.1. Con:
      Moral values are pertinent to objective effects where particular individuals, groups, religions or school of thought only follow different approaches and/or differently subjectively weigh certain aspects or effects. In this case, these may for example differently weigh a) the importance or moral imperative of avoiding suffering, miserable lives, lifespans much shorter than potential lifespans and b) to which degree this applies to non-human animals that are less sentient than average humans.

    1.5.23. Pro:
    The ignorance and confusion about how animals are treated may have been deliberately caused by the meat industry lack of transparency [762] and misleading advertising. [763]

    1.5.24. Pro:
    Relating to the standards of good behaviour (not killing / not imprisoning), fairness (not profiting on others pain / not imposing artificial insemination to females or robbing them their byproducts -eggs or milk), and honesty (not enslaving entire species -farm animals / not robbing other intelligent and sentient beings offspring to subdue them as well), i.e. morals [764], eating meat is wrong, especially when there are alternatives [765].

      1.5.24.1. Con:
      It is not realistic to treat all living things equally and apply the same moral code.

    1.5.25. Pro:
    For those who eat meat, it may also mean that they neither have a developed empathy nor a developed compassion - leaving farm animals out of their circles of compassion [766], or just that they don't have reliable sources of information [767]. (e.g. "suicide food". [768])

    1.5.26. Pro:
    -> See 1.5.2.12.3.

    1.5.27. Con:
    Not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.

      1.5.27.1. Con:
      There are very few opportunities to eat animals killed by non-human causes. Eating only those animals would be very similar to not eating any meat at all.

        1.5.27.1.1. Con:
        If you're eating less meat you are still eating meat.

        1.5.27.1.2. Con:
        It doesn't matter how the animal died that doesn't change that the meat would still be wasted.

          1.5.27.1.2.1. Con:
          Not all meat from all animal deaths would be usable to humans.

      1.5.27.2. Pro:
      Many religions use animal sacrifices. It would be a waste to not then eat those animals.

        1.5.27.2.1. Con:
        Sacrificing animals for religious purposes is also unethical, and we should stop doing it.

          1.5.27.2.1.1. Pro:
          There are a number of religious practices that have been outlawed, even though they have had a large following, because they infringed on the rights of others.

            1.5.27.2.1.1.1. Pro:
            Sati [769] was a practice among some Hindu communities according to which a widow committed suicide or immolated herself on her husband's pyre. It was made illegal in British India in 1829 [770].

          1.5.27.2.1.2. Con:
          The definition of 'unethical' can mean many different things to many different people of many different backgrounds, religions, cultures, etc. Just because people disagree with an aspect of someone's religion doesn't mean it's okay to write it off. Given that they animals are already being killed their meat should not be wasted.

        1.5.27.2.2. Pro:
        Religious festivities like Eid al-Adha [771] involve animal sacrifice.

        1.5.27.2.3. Pro:
        The religion of Tengrism [772] involves animal sacrifice.

        1.5.27.2.4. Pro:
        A variety of animals are sacrificed in accordance with Hinduism [773].

      1.5.27.3. Con:
      Selling meat from animals that have been killed anyway creates a demand for meat, which then encourages people to kill more animals than otherwise would have died.

      1.5.27.4. Con:
      Since a lot of institutions and professionals sustain that a diet that contains meat will necessarily cause a lot of health problems for the eater, not eating meat is not a waste. If someone doesn't want to drink poison, we would not say that they are 'wasting' poison.

      1.5.27.5. Con:
      Most of us wouldn't like the idea of eating a pet, regardless of its cause of death. Moral wrongness can vary depending on a person's view of how a dead body ought to be treated, and this subjective moral view varies wildly throughout culture, and from person to person.

      1.5.27.6. Con:
      We don't consider the food we feed to our pets "wasted". Every organism eventually "feeds" the ecosystem in which it dies (including humans), thus it's invalid to call organic matter objectively "wasted" simply because humans aren't the ones eating it.

      1.5.27.7. Pro:
      Many societies, admittedly, less that are around today, cannibalized [774] their dead for religious purposes, out of reverence for them.

      1.5.27.8. Con:
      Many animals that we eat or commodify were brought into existence by humans and would otherwise not exist. By reducing the demand for meat, we reduce the animals that are killed for any reason. Therefore, it is only a waste because we have created something we do not need.

        1.5.27.8.1. Con:
        Never existing is worse than dying because if you exist you at least were able to experience some form of life.

          1.5.27.8.1.1. Con:
          It may be preferable to not exist, rather than to experience an existence which is mostly unpleasant or torturous.

      1.5.27.9. Pro:
      Humans have morally acceptable reasons to kill animals besides eating them. If a human has a good reason to kill an animal it would be immoral to waste the edible sections of that animal.

        1.5.27.9.1. Pro:
        Hunting is beneficial to the environment as it helps prevent over-population of several species of animal that, if un-controlled, would destroy the environments they live in.

      1.5.27.10. Pro:
      In practice, yes, but to be precise, eating the flesh from dead bodies is not cruel nor immoral if the act can be shown to never create demand for the murdering of animals. A free-range animal that dies from natural causes could have its body eaten without causing any suffering. Anonymously eating murder meat purely from others' leftovers also causes no suffering. Necessarily cruel and immoral are the various acts of torture and finally the murder, not the flesh-eating part which has exceptions.

        1.5.27.10.1. Con:
        This is not a practically viable method of sourcing meat. Who would watch for such incidental deaths?

      1.5.27.11. Pro:
      Young goats cannot be kept or sold [775] because they fight and killing and burying them is just a waste. Eating them is a moral and ecological solution.

        1.5.27.11.1. Con:
        One could just stop breeding them in the first place.

          1.5.27.11.1.1. Con:
          Breeding goats is necessary for many people to survive, e.g. to get their milk. Stopping this will eliminate their foundation of life.

            1.5.27.11.1.1.1. Pro:
            Goats are deeply embedded in almost every African [776] culture.

            1.5.27.11.1.1.2. Pro:
            Women [777] in poor countries are especially dependent on goat farming. Stopping it altogether would hurt the most vulnerable.

        1.5.27.11.2. Pro:
        Male goats produce no benefit for the farmer.

          1.5.27.11.2.1. Con:
          -> See 1.5.27.11.1.

      1.5.27.12. Pro:
      If animals get fatally hurt it is better to eat them than to waste the meat. Horses [778], for example, are highly unlikely to recover from breaking a bone.

        1.5.27.12.1. Con:
        It is rarely the case that we eat meat that comes from accidentally hurt or killed animals. For the main part the meat we consume comes from livestock farming.

          1.5.27.12.1.1. Con:
          Even if this is true the parent claim is speaking of wasting meat from animals killed under other circumstances than on ranches/farms.

        1.5.27.12.2. Pro:
        Severely injured horses are often brought to slaughterhouses [779].

  1.6. Pro:
  -> See 1.2.5.6.1.

  1.7. Con:
  The taste of meat is delicious and brings many people pleasure in a manner that vegetarian food cannot fully imitate.

    1.7.1. Con:
    Cultured meat [780] will likely soon be available to the general public, scale up over time and taste similar.

    1.7.2. Con:
    Non-meat products can offer an equivalently pleasing food experience.

      1.7.2.1. Pro:
      Soy or seitan products can exhibit a big variety of tastes because of the different spices added.

      1.7.2.2. Con:
      Unless the taste, smell, texture and consistency of meat can be precisely imitated, some people would disagree. This point has not yet been reached, hence non-meat products do not offer an equivalent experience to everybody.

        1.7.2.2.1. Con:
        Meat analogues based on soy protein or wheat gluten are getting close [781] to imitating the taste and texture of real meat and have been part of the food culture [782] in places such as Taiwan for a long time.

          1.7.2.2.1.1. Pro:
          Companies such as Impossible Foods [783] and Beyond Meat [784] are gaining momentum all the time elsewhere in the world as well, with the former opening its first large-scale production plant and the latter being sold in WholeFoods across the USA. Reviews of their products so far are very positive, with a 'meat-centric' celebrity chef debuting the Impossible Burger [785] at one of his restaurants.

          1.7.2.2.1.2. Con:
          Soy in particular but also other legumes, pulses and grains contain varying amounts of phytoestrogens. There is ongoing debate as to whether they can be consumed in quantity by males without undesirable side effects such as reduction in the production of male hormones and increasing feminisation.

          1.7.2.2.1.3. Pro:
          Lab-grown meat is predicted to be on-offer in a restaurant within a few years. Inasmuch as the normalization of lab-grown meat lowers the bar for eating non-animal meat—thereby exerting pressure on animal-meat eaters (all else equal)—and inasmuch as quantified, aggregated predictions serve as evidence for the likelihood of an event, a prediction (like this one [786]) that a restaurant will serve cultured meat by 2021 supports the "Eating Meat is Wrong" argument.

      1.7.2.3. Pro:
      -> See 1.7.2.2.1.

      1.7.2.4. Pro:
      Artificial meat [787], which imitates the taste of real meat but is lab-grown, is being developed and could replace the taste experiences of real meat without the harm caused to animals, and with significantly less environmental consequences.

        1.7.2.4.1. Pro:
        At the end of 2018, there was a worldwide total of 27 companies developing cell-based meat and seafood products, of which 15 have already raised external funding (p. 5 [788]).

          1.7.2.4.1.1. Pro:
          Memphis Meats [789], a start-up founded in 2015, is already producing lab grown meat from animal cells and has recently gained $161 million in new investment.

        1.7.2.4.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.7.2.2.1.

        1.7.2.4.3. Con:
        Lab grown meat is not absolutely and objectively preferable to animal meat.

          1.7.2.4.3.1. Pro:
          Previous artificial "improvements" and products have later been shown to have downsides that were not immediately apparent e.g. pollution from industry, carcinogenic substances, toxins like asbestos and lead paints which were not immediately identified before being widely used.

          1.7.2.4.3.2. Pro:
          The production of artificial meat still costs too much energy. 7-45% less energy cost [790] will not be a viable solution for the growing meat demand in the world.

        1.7.2.4.4. Con:
        -> See 1.7.2.4.3.2.

        1.7.2.4.5. Con:
        Long term studies must be done to evaluate the health impact of regular consumption of lab grown meat before it is considered a viable alternative.

        1.7.2.4.6. Con:
        If lab-grown animal protein analogues are an acceptable resolution to the problem of eating meat, it follows that the quarrel is not strictly with eating meat but with some secondary consequence of it.

      1.7.2.5. Con:
      If that actually were the case, people wouldn't be eating meat.

        1.7.2.5.1. Con:
        There has been reluctance among meat eaters to try other alternatives. Recent advancements in non-meat alternatives, combined with recipes etc. at our fingertips, could open people up to other ways of eating, if tried.

          1.7.2.5.1.1. Con:
          While that claim is true, it is also true that many meat eaters *have* tried these alternatives, and although to many they taste good, they do not take the place of meat.

          1.7.2.5.1.2. Pro:
          The technology on this is experiencing somewhat of a renaissance with products like the Impossible Burger [791] creating very convincing meat substitutes.

        1.7.2.5.2. Con:
        Increasing numbers of people are taking up vegetarianism and veganism.

        1.7.2.5.3. Con:
        There are reasons beyond the taste and pleasure for why people continue to eat meat - authorities suggesting it (whether parents in childhood or dieticians/dietary specialists/diet-writers), the social acceptance of and ease of access to meat, encouragement from others to eat meat, other social factors, etc.

      1.7.2.6. Con:
      If it were the case that non-meat products were universally as good as meat, then vegetarians would not try, and also not to such a degree fail, to replicate the taste of meat.

        1.7.2.6.1. Pro:
        This is because vegetarians still like the taste of meat [792], despite being aware of the consequences.

      1.7.2.7. Con:
      Meat imitation products are expensive and are not a viable option for low-income individuals and families.

        1.7.2.7.1. Con:
        As technology advances and production scales up, they will become more affordable and available.

          1.7.2.7.1.1. Con:
          But they are not that yet. Arguments can't be made through hypotheticals and predictions. Once they are in fact affordable you will have an argument. Until then this is baseless assumption.

            1.7.2.7.1.1.1. Con:
            This debate suggests a future action - that we should stop eating meat. That future will not be the same as the present, both due to whatever decision we (as all humanity) make on continuing to eat meat, and other factors. As such, hypotheticals and predictions regarding the future are highly relevant, especially hypotheticals and predictions regarding factors which will be affected by continuing or ceasing to eat meat.

      1.7.2.8. Pro:
      In fact, meat itself has little to no taste, it's the texture it has and spices and flavors we add to it that makes it delicious. Other textured proteins like soy can have the same delicious taste and be almost unrecognizable.

        1.7.2.8.1. Con:
        The fact that meat has little to no taste can be refuted by anyone who has already tasted meat directly from the producer with no spices or other additives.

        1.7.2.8.2. Con:
        Broths from meat are often used to season foods or as a base for foods.  For example, some soups may start with a chicken broth because it has a better taste than just using water.

      1.7.2.9. Pro:
      Faux meats are getting better over time as more people demand it. With more demand fake meats will taste better.

      1.7.2.10. Con:
      The very knowledge that one is eating an animal is pleasurable to many people and cannot be imitated with non-animal products. Certain meats carry status in many cultures, such as beef in the US.

      1.7.2.11. Pro:
      Vegetarian food offers more choices when meat is taken off the food plate. Usually there are small number of meat choices (mostly chicken or beef with the occasional turkey, fish, and seafood). The substitutions for this are numerous, from extra sides to faux meats.

      1.7.2.12. Pro:
      Eating is pleasurable in general. Finding more pleasure in one food type than in another is subjective and largely determined by personal experience with recepies and cooking, family traditions, memories, habits of one's environment, etc.

        1.7.2.12.1. Pro:
        In vegetarian cultures like for example Indian Jainism eating meat is regarded as being far less pleasurable, rather vulgar and less refined than a vegetarian meal prepared with the proper skills.

      1.7.2.13. Pro:
      Taste is an acquired habit. Some cultures that eat dogs, snakes, rabbits, snails etc. also do it because they acquired those tastes even though in other cultures eating one or more of those animals is considered disgusting. Same is with vegan food. There are several cultures that promote vegetarianism and of late veganism has also grown significantly. Also, all spices and flavorful ingredients added to food to enrich taste, like pepper, chilies, garlic, ginger, basil etc are all in fact, plants.

      1.7.2.14. Pro:
      Stopping eating meat just means dropping a few ingredients. There are lots and lots of ingredients left to use and be creative with.

      1.7.2.15. Pro:
      The taste of vegetables, fruits and grains is popular as well.

    1.7.3. Pro:
    Meat is convenient and consumer friendly.

      1.7.3.1. Con:
      Not eating meat is generally cheaper [793].

        1.7.3.1.1. Pro:
        According to one study [794], a vegetarian meal plan can be cheaper than a meat-based meal plan with the same nutritional value and impact on chronic disease risk.

        1.7.3.1.2. Pro:
        The most expensive [795] element of American food servings are animal products such as meats and poultry.

        1.7.3.1.3. Pro:
        Unprocessed vegetarian products, which can be used as meat replacements, are cheaper than meat itself.

          1.7.3.1.3.1. Con:
          Unprocessed vegetarian products, such as lentils and unprocessed soy, are bland without seasoning and taste nothing like meat; processed meatless products - those that claim to be the closest in flavour to, and therefore the closest literal 'replacements' of, their meat equivalents - are more expensive than meat.

            1.7.3.1.3.1.1. Pro:
            The Beyond Meat Burger, which claims to look and taste almost exactly like a beef burger [796], was being sold at $5.99 (£4.93) for two 4oz patties at the time of its launch; real beef burgers, even if gourmet, cost the same or much less [797] than this.

            1.7.3.1.3.1.2. Con:
            Specialty foods like prepared veggie burgers can be more expensive than their non-vegetarian counterparts, but this is the case with most pre-prepared food, vegetarian or otherwise; buying specialty products is not necessary to lead a satisfying and nutritious (vegetarian) lifestyle.

          1.7.3.1.3.2. Pro:
          Meat prices rise [798] faster than vegetable prices in the recent years. This indicates a trend change.

          1.7.3.1.3.3. Con:
          Since 1978 [799] the price for fresh fruits and vegetables has been rising, while the price for meat is declining.

            1.7.3.1.3.3.1. Con:
            This suggests that meat may be cheaper than fruits and vegetables in the future, yet it does not tell us whether meat is cheaper right now.

            1.7.3.1.3.3.2. Con:
            -> See 1.7.3.1.3.2.

          1.7.3.1.3.4. Pro:
          When comparing the average price of non-animal protein with animal protein (especially beef), vegetarian products tend to cost less [800].

        1.7.3.1.4. Con:
        Since people still choose to eat meat despite the relatively higher price, this indicates that eating meat is very pleasurable for them.

        1.7.3.1.5. Con:
        It is not plausible for some people to live solely on a diet without meats. The reason it would be impossible at the current moment is that the pricing of fruits and vegetables costs more per calorie [801] than meat and is not possible for many families with a lower budget.

        1.7.3.1.6. Con:
        Meat is often cheaper and easier to store for low-income households

        1.7.3.1.7. Con:
        -> See 1.7.3.1.3.3.

        1.7.3.1.8. Pro:
        Meat is so expensive that the world's most expensive food comes from an animal [802].

        1.7.3.1.9. Pro:
        As the production of meat is more expensive than a vegetarian based food industry, the market price of meatless foods is by logic cheaper.

          1.7.3.1.9.1. Con:
          The link between production and retail price is often weak. The production costs of razor blades, for example [803], is 5p while the retail price stands at £2.43.

          1.7.3.1.9.2. Pro:
          The impact of production price on retail price depends on the elasticity of demand [804] for meat. As this is low [805] for meat the production costs can directly be burdened on the consumer.

      1.7.3.2. Pro:
      It is sometimes difficult to be on a meatless diet, especially if you do not have the time to cook for yourself or if you eat out with friends.

        1.7.3.2.1. Con:
        You do not necessarily need time to cook if you are a vegetarian. Most fruits and vegetables can be consumed in their raw state or with little preparation.

        1.7.3.2.2. Con:
        Not having time to cook as a meateater is even more difficult, as meat generally (with only very few exceptions) has to be prepared.

        1.7.3.2.3. Con:
        It is only difficult to stay on a meatless diet because meat is so ubiquitous under the status quo. If less people ate meat, more vegetarian options would become available.

          1.7.3.2.3.1. Con:
          Individuals should make their decisions about whether or not to consume meat based on the situation they face, which is the status quo. The status quo therefore relevant when determining whether or not an individual should eat meat.

      1.7.3.3. Con:
      Human behavior should not simply be based upon questions of convenience, as other factors weigh heavier.

        1.7.3.3.1. Pro:
        If people were to act only based upon convenience, this would lead to a wide neglect of dutiful and/or moral behaviour (e.g. going to work, recycling garbage etc.)

      1.7.3.4. Con:
      There are many meatless foods which are also convenient and consumer friendly, such as bread, pasta, fruits, cookies etc.

      1.7.3.5. Pro:
      Not eating meat limits food options. Four out of ten [806] former vegetarians state that it was difficult to stay "pure" in terms of their diet and that they were bored with the available food options.

        1.7.3.5.1. Con:
        "Getting bored" with available food options may be a result of a lack of cooking skills, rather than specifically related to being vegetarian.

        1.7.3.5.2. Con:
        If more humans stop eating meat entirely, there will be a greater incentive for restaurants and supermarkets to develop a broader range of vegetarian food options.

        1.7.3.5.3. Con:
        Focusing on having meat as the central part of your diet limits your overall food options, since other non-meat alternatives, many richer in nutrients, in a variety of plant based products are overlooked as possible main courses.

          1.7.3.5.3.1. Con:
          Not everybody who eats meat "focuses on having [it] as the central part of [their] diet". Many dishes include meat as only one component, but this is still enough to be considered "eating meat" and thus, not strictly vegetarian.

        1.7.3.5.4. Con:
        Many moral life choices are difficult, and many immoral life choices are easy. The difficulty or ease of a choice has very little bearing on the morality of that choice.

      1.7.3.6. Pro:
      There are many restaurants that do not offer meatless products.

        1.7.3.6.1. Con:
        -> See 1.7.3.5.2.

        1.7.3.6.2. Con:
        Many "classic" dishes - such as pizza, pasta, sushi, gratins or potato bake - can easily be made without meat.

        1.7.3.6.3. Con:
        It is very common in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cuisine to have a large variety of side dishes, many of which are vegetarian.

          1.7.3.6.3.1. Pro:
          There are many vegetarian Korean side dishes (banchan, 반찬 [807]) that are easy to make.

          1.7.3.6.3.2. Pro:
          The Chinese cuisine offers a huge variety of vegetarian side dishes [808].

        1.7.3.6.4. Con:
        Even in a steakhouse/churrascaria you will be able to order meatless sides such as green beans, a salad or a variety of sides based on potatos.

        1.7.3.6.5. Pro:
        In countries like South Korea and China restaurants that specialize in barbecue and fried chicken are among the most popular places for social outings but they usually have no vegetarian dishes on offer.

          1.7.3.6.5.1. Con:
          If you are a non-meat eater or want to go out with a friend who is, you would obviously not choose a restaurant that specializes in barbecue and fried chicken.

            1.7.3.6.5.1.1. Pro:
            BBQ and fried chicken joints are not the only available restaurants in countries (South Korea, China) with such a rich variety in its cusine.

          1.7.3.6.5.2. Con:
          Korean barbecue comes with many side dishes [809] such as green onion salad or a fresh vegetable dish including lettuce, cucumbers and peppers.

            1.7.3.6.5.2.1. Con:
            As the argument states, only the side dishes are meat-free. The argument that a meatless diet comes with obstacles in certain countries is thus sustained.

          1.7.3.6.5.3. Con:
          -> See 1.7.3.6.3.2.

          1.7.3.6.5.4. Con:
          Typical main dishes served with BBQ include Jamji jjigae [810], Doenjang jjigae [811] or Naengmyeon [812].

        1.7.3.6.6. Con:
        Even food chains like McDonald's offer meatless products such as french fries or a dedicated veggie burger.

          1.7.3.6.6.1. Pro:
          The most popular McDonald's product is a meatless [813] one: french fries.

            1.7.3.6.6.1.1. Con:
            French fries are only the most frequent dish because they are served with every other meal. This blurs the statistic.

      1.7.3.7. Con:
      Meat has to be prepared, whereas most vegetables can already be consumed in their raw state.

        1.7.3.7.1. Con:
        Tomatoes are healthier [814] when they are processed with heat.

          1.7.3.7.1.1. Con:
          However, vitamin C levels declined [815] by 10% in tomatoes cooked for two minutes—and 29% in tomatoes that were cooked for half an hour at 190.4 degrees F (88 degrees C).

        1.7.3.7.2. Pro:
        Some veggies, including broccoli, are even healthier [816] raw rather than cooked.

        1.7.3.7.3. Con:
        In certain cases meat can be eaten raw.

          1.7.3.7.3.1. Pro:
          Steak tartare [817] is a dish made from finely chopped or minced meat.

          1.7.3.7.3.2. Pro:
          Carpaccio [818] is a traditional starter dish, containing raw meat.

          1.7.3.7.3.3. Pro:
          The Inuit [819] are known for eating raw meat.

            1.7.3.7.3.3.1. Con:
            The Inuit live in a geographical area characterized by very cold temperatures almost for the whole year. Therefore they do not have to worry about foul meat like elsewhere in the world.

        1.7.3.7.4. Con:
        Quite a few vegetables need cooking as well.

          1.7.3.7.4.1. Pro:
          Leguminous plants, very often used as meat replacement, need to be cooked before eaten.

          1.7.3.7.4.2. Pro:
          Potatoes, a staple of lots of vegetarian diets, need to be cooked.

        1.7.3.7.5. Pro:
        All salad vegetables can be consumed raw.

      1.7.3.8. Pro:
      In a more precarious context, with a small budget and little time, pleasure can more easily be found through meat consumption. The food market is still largely organised around meat consumption, making it easily accesible and cheap through mass-production. Quality cooking without meat requires more skill, more time and more fresh ingredients.

      1.7.3.9. Con:
      Although meat is convenient and consumer-friendly in the short run, our current levels of meat consumption are harmful to the climate [820], our health [821] and thus the convenience of our existence in the long run.

        1.7.3.9.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.11.2.

        1.7.3.9.2. Pro:
        -> See 1.2.2.

        1.7.3.9.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.4.8.6.

      1.7.3.10. Pro:
      Processed meat products such as hot dogs or BiFi [822] are easy to consume to-go products.

        1.7.3.10.1. Con:
        Processed products on the basis of meat substitutes (soy sausages etc.) are comparably easy to consume.

        1.7.3.10.2. Pro:
        You do not need cutlery/crockery to consume those.

        1.7.3.10.3. Con:
        So are most kinds of fruits without a hard shell (such as bananas, apples, oranges, grapes etc.) and you do not even produce plastic-waste by consuming them to-go. Plus they are healthy as well.

          1.7.3.10.3.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.7.3.10.2.

    1.7.4. Con:
    Popularity and pleasure has no relevance to what is right or wrong.

      1.7.4.1. Con:
      This begs the question [823] that eating meat of any kind is immoral or unethical. If eating meat is not immoral, then taste and pleasure are relevant for the discussion.

      1.7.4.2. Con:
      Since humans have a higher level of consciousness and experience than animals, it is possible that the pleasure of eating meat is greater than the suffering animals experience from a quick, painless death (depending on the farm, treatment, etc.).

        1.7.4.2.1. Con:
        While human pleasures are temporary and often secondary to other experiences, animal suffering and death is always salient and permanent.

      1.7.4.3. Pro:
      If pleasure is something that makes an action right, then something which causes the opposite - a lack of pleasure, or worse, a large amount of pain - such as torturing and slaughtering animals, is wrong.

      1.7.4.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.3.9.3.3.

      1.7.4.5. Con:
      Many people are pushed to give up many forms of satisfaction, such as taking time to have fun, learn a skill, or explore the world, because they are not productive ways to spend time. Cooking and eating are basic needs that can still be pleasurable, making food-related pleasures special and worthy of moral consideration.

        1.7.4.5.1. Con:
        Just because other sources of pleasure are rare or stigmatized, does not mean it becomes ethical to indulge in morally questionable sources of pleasure.

      1.7.4.6. Con:
      Concepts of right and wrong are formed by societies, and thus decided by popularity.

        1.7.4.6.1. Pro:
        Democratic countries, which are founded on principles of fairness that are maintained by a popular majority vote, regularly pass laws about the production, handling, and consumption of meat that are influenced by what most pleases their citizens.

        1.7.4.6.2. Con:
        The concepts of right and wrong change as society changes. This changes are made possible by people who think differently to the majority

        1.7.4.6.3. Con:
        This is a typical example of argumentum ad populum [824], which is a logical fallacy.

          1.7.4.6.3.1. Con:
          Societies cannot commit logical fallacies because they are not making deductive logical arguments, they are making pragmatic decisions with an imperfect consensus.

      1.7.4.7. Pro:
      As people decide what choices are "right" or "wrong" based on how the choices serve the end goals they happen to value--be those goals the raising the quality of life of the world as a whole, just that of humans, or making more money as an individual--and those goals may not be shared by all of one's population, right and wrong are in fact concepts isolated from popular opinion.

      1.7.4.8. Con:
      Some ethical systems are built upon the concept of pleasure as the highest good (hedonic morality), so pleasure does indeed factor into judgments of right and wrong.

      1.7.4.9. Pro:
      It is not morally justifiable to value one's own taste over an animal's life.

        1.7.4.9.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.5.2.12.3.14.1.3.

      1.7.4.10. Con:
      Both popularity and pleasure are relevant to "right and wrong", or the concerns of ethics and morality. They certainly do not equate to morality on a one to one basis, not are they interchangeable with ethics or morality, but they are entirely relevant. Nearly every attempt at a cohesive system of ethics must take into account what is pleasurable to the individual and the larger society as well as the beliefs held by the majority of the population.

    1.7.5. Con:
    It is not clear that the additional pleasure (if any) of eating a meal containing meat compared to eating a meal without outweighs the suffering of the animal bred, raised and killed for their meat.

      1.7.5.1. Pro:
      As humans live in more advanced societies, it becomes less moral for those humans to eat meat.  If it's "eat meat or starve," there's no moral issue there at all.  On the other hand, if eating meat is simply one more lifestyle choice, it is significantly less moral, because if you ascribe animals any moral value at all (ask, "Do I think torturing animals for fun is okay?"), then at some point their moral value outweighs the fleeting human desire for "tasty".

      1.7.5.2. Pro:
      The claim seems to be that pleasure is good and therefore the act of eating meat for some people is pleasurable and therefore good. However, in the quantity of suffering vs pleasure, eating meat comes at a staggering cost of suffering at a level that far exceeds the pleasure experienced by people. If all 7 billion people were eating meat and enjoying it, that is far fewer than the 56 billion animals slaughtered every year and the billions more suffering on factory farms. www.animalequality.net [825]

      1.7.5.3. Pro:
      There is no moral justification for eating meat that is more convincing than a justification for not eating meat while having the alternatives that there are today. The "superior taste of meat products" can not be part of a moral justification when it comes to killing living beings.

    1.7.6. Pro:
    Pleasure is important to human quality of life, so if meat consumption is more pleasurable than anticipated, abstinence could have a meaningful negative impact on quality of life. The overwhelming popularity of meat throughout almost all cultures could be an indication that eating meat is enormously pleasurable.

      1.7.6.1. Con:
      Sensory pleasure cannot be used as a justification for eating meat because we would never accept it as a justification for any other ethically questionable act.

      1.7.6.2. Con:
      Animals are believed to have sentience and hence quality of life as well, so the degradation in their life may be greater than the benefit of eating meat.

    1.7.7. Con:
    What people commonly refer to the "taste of meat" is directly linked to one of the five basic tastes: umami [826]. This taste can also be found in vegetable foods [827] such as miso, seaweeds, tomatoes, mushrooms and many others, thus providing an alternative way to achieve satisfying flavors without animal protein.

    1.7.8. Con:
    Eating other animals (human beings are animals) is not necessary for our survival, it's for our pleasure, and this pleasure has to be balanced with the cost of the victims, which is too high (suffering and death).

      1.7.8.1. Con:
      Death and suffering could easily be ignored; even though we don't need to eat meat to survive, we certainly don't need to stop killing animals for ethical reasons if you don't care about them

      1.7.8.2. Con:
      This depends on how one values non-human animals' quality of life (this may be difficult to assess), their suffering (this varies per living conditions and slaughter practice), and their early death (when compared to potential lifespan). The quality of life of insects is not a common subject of ethics and similarly the treatment of other animals has little ethical value to many.

    1.7.9. Pro:
    It is because the taste of meat is so good and popular that scientists try to imitate it and create vegetarian "meat" products.

      1.7.9.1. Pro:
      Scientists have developed a so-called "facon [828]", which is a vegetarian bacon.

      1.7.9.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.7.2.2.1.

      1.7.9.3. Con:
      They do not imitate meat because of the taste, but because consumers do not want to miss out on certain dishes that usually contain meat, for example burgers.

      1.7.9.4. Pro:
      Until artificial meat is provided at a competitive price, people will eat animals because meat is a simple and nourishing food.

        1.7.9.4.1. Con:
        This addresses the economic question of eating meat, but not the question of whether eating meat is moral or not.

      1.7.9.5. Con:
      Meat "imitations" are helpful in terms of transition to vegetarianism. Experienced vegetarians do not need such products, therefore meat "imitations" are not an attempt to fill in some void in vegetarian diet.

      1.7.9.6. Con:
      If the taste is imitable there is no need to actually eat meat, as one can consume other vegetarian products with the same "fantastic" taste.

        1.7.9.6.1. Pro:
        It is not difficult to replace meat with non-meat products that taste similar.

          1.7.9.6.1.1. Pro:
          Tofu can be used instead of meat for example in stir fry dishes.

          1.7.9.6.1.2. Pro:
          When making burgers, the meat patty can either be replaced with a vegetarian patty (pre-made or homemade) or with an equal portion (size-wise) of vegetables that have meatlike consistency (e.g. mushrooms, fried zucchini, kohlrabi).

          1.7.9.6.1.3. Con:
          Raw or aged tenderloin beef, which is required for grilling a proper steak, can be replaced by nothing.

          1.7.9.6.1.4. Con:
          All kinds of roasts are pretty difficult to replicate without meat, e.g. a classic "Krustenbraten" seems almost impossible without meat.

            1.7.9.6.1.4.1. Con:
            Seitan [829] and tempeh [830] are commonly used for vegetarian roast dishes.

              1.7.9.6.1.4.1.1. Con:
              Neither Seitan or tempeh are able to replicate an essential part of roasts: crackling.

          1.7.9.6.1.5. Con:
          A 'similar' taste or texture or aroma or nutrient profile would not satisfy those who desire or require real meat.

            1.7.9.6.1.5.1. Con:
            "Real" meat is an arbitrary distinction. What we know as "meat" is the combination of a broad variety of qualities and traits, some of which are desired, others of which are neutral or even undesirable. In theory, any desirable trait can be replicated, while undesirable traits can be eliminated.

  1.8. Con:
  Consuming meat is an important part of many cultures and religions.

    1.8.1. Con:
    Cultural components change over time: cultural transformation is a natural dynamic process.

      1.8.1.1. Con:
      Cultural transformation should not be forced and attempts to do so rarely succeed, cultures only transform gradually as a result of natural processes.

        1.8.1.1.1. Con:
        In 675 AD, the use of livestock and the consumption of some wild animals (horse, cattle, dogs, monkeys, birds) was banned in Japan [831] by Emperor Temmu, due to the influence of Buddhism. During the twelve hundred years from the Nara period to the Meiji restoration in the latter half of the 19th century, Japanese people enjoyed vegetarian-style meals.

          1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro:
          Japan has a rich tradition of cooking with vegetables [832]. As of today, meatless dishes [833] still make up for a big part of Japanese cuisine.

            1.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Western assumptions about life as a vegetarian in Japan are being called out as naive and unrealistic [834] by people struggling with it. As one writer put it [835]: "Everything in Japan has meat in it."

        1.8.1.1.2. Con:
        If humans stopped eating meat, this would arguably be due to the natural process of meat production becoming gradually unsustainable.

      1.8.1.2. Pro:
      Eating habits change, and meat has not always been an integral part of most cultures. Only relatively recently [836] has the consumption of meat become wide-spread, for example during the mid-19th century in Europe and not until the mid-20th century in large parts of China.

        1.8.1.2.1. Pro:
        Meat has been a rare and expensive good for most of human history, so it could not have been a strong cultural component.

          1.8.1.2.1.1. Con:
          The availability of meat and the quantity of its consumption do not tell us much about the cultural role it played. Some goods play a role regardless of or even through their scarcity.

            1.8.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
            Gold [837], as a scarce good, has been of tremendous significance, viewed by most cultures as a symbol of wealth and prosperity.

          1.8.1.2.1.2. Pro:
          The diet of a farm worker [838] in 18th century England would consist mostly of root vegetables, bread, cheese, butter, sugar, tea, and a little milk.

          1.8.1.2.1.3. Pro:
          Up until the beginning of the 20th century, Bavarian farmers ate meat only for special occasions, about 4 - 5 times a year.

          1.8.1.2.1.4. Pro:
          In most traditional European agricultural societies the annual meat consumption rarely went beyond 5-10kg [839], which is less than 10% [840] of today's per-capita consumption.

            1.8.1.2.1.4.1. Con:
            The scarcity of meat makes it precious, it doesn't make it less important culturally.

        1.8.1.2.2. Con:
        Meat was nevertheless an important cultural component before its consumption in large doses became widespread. People highly valued it, but they simply could not afford it.

          1.8.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          Henry IV, was called "le bon roi", because he advocated a "chicken in every pot on sundays." [841] This shows, that even though people did not eat a lot of meat, they still valued it highliy.

            1.8.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
            Meat was valued in the past because it was rare, and thus a sign of wealth, luxury and opulence. This no longer holds relevance to today.

          1.8.1.2.2.2. Con:
          -> See 1.8.1.2.1.

          1.8.1.2.2.3. Pro:
          During the times [842] of Louis XIV the rich mainly ate spicy cooked meat dishes. This shows that meat was a cultural asset, at least if one could afford it.

            1.8.1.2.2.3.1. Con:
            The king himself loved [843] fruits and vegetables.

          1.8.1.2.2.4. Con:
          Convictions surrounding different foodstuffs, and their corresponding cultural importance, change over time.

            1.8.1.2.2.4.1. Pro:
            In early 18th century Europe, vegetables were believed to have no health benefits and to be almost impossible to digest.

              1.8.1.2.2.4.1.1. Con:
              Vegetables may have had a bad reputation for some time, but this did not have a big effect on common peoples' actual eating habits.

            1.8.1.2.2.4.2. Pro:
            Cannibalism [844] was, in certain times and places, preferable to vegetarianism.

            1.8.1.2.2.4.3. Pro:
            The potato can be viewed as the decisive innovation – even as a central cultural norm [845] – during the emergence of the modern system of dishes and meals in the 18th century, but it only entered the dietary culture of the broad masses of central Europe during the 17th century.

            1.8.1.2.2.4.4. Con:
            That cultural convictions change does not imply they will change.

              1.8.1.2.2.4.4.1. Con:
              The rise of vegetarianism [846] and veganism [847] around the world [848] pretty clearly indicates that cultural values around food have the capacity to change.

          1.8.1.2.2.5. Pro:
          Consumption of different type of meat serves to separate social classes by the price of certain pieces of meat, such as the Tri-tip [849] (or 'Bürgermeisterstück' in German which means 'major's piece').

          1.8.1.2.2.6. Pro:
          In traditional agricultural European societies many animals were more valuable [850] as tools for plowing or producing fertiliser, or as a renewable resource for producing milk or eggs, rather than being killed for a one-off supply of meat.

          1.8.1.2.2.7. Pro:
          Because meat was expensive it was saved for special occasions and holidays like Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving.

        1.8.1.2.3. Con:
        The argument equivocates cultures of years past with current day cultures.  Modern cultures do, as you point out, consume meat as a central and normal role in diet.

        1.8.1.2.4. Pro:
        Eating meat is culturally based. There is no biological or cultural evidence that sustains an obligatory diet based on animal flesh.

        1.8.1.2.5. Pro:
        Cultures are changing quickly and so meat eating can be phased out without causing harm.

          1.8.1.2.5.1. Pro:
          Many cuisines, such as in Persian [851] or Hindu [852], do have restrictions on which meat to eat and still enjoy a rich culture. Phasing out meat would work similarly.

            1.8.1.2.5.1.1. Con:
            Geographical differences in cuisine developed in part because of the availability of particular game and types of grasses [853]. Thus, cultural patterns describing the phasing out of meat are not reproducible in other societies.

      1.8.1.3. Pro:
      -> See 1.8.1.2.2.4.

      1.8.1.4. Pro:
      The 21st century's marked by globalism and increasing interconnectivity of all cultures. In other words, a global culture is the new paradigm. The interconnectivity of our actions obligate us to behave in a way that is sustainable for all subsidiary cultures. Using one culture's norms as justification for a practice that harms the global society is not an adequate response. This debate, and Kialo in general, is the articulation of a global society working out its ethos in a dialectical process.

      1.8.1.5. Pro:
      Humans' meat consumption patterns today are not the same as those of their stone-age ancestors. Naturally, the kind of hunting and consumption of meat practised by stone-age humanoids does not, therefore, hold the same importance in modern-day culture.

        1.8.1.5.1. Pro:
        Many of the animals hunted and consumed by our ancestors are now extinct, such as mammoths, mastodons, aurochs and cave bears.

        1.8.1.5.2. Con:
        It does not matter what kind of animal is consumed or how it has been obtained: humans' meat consumption can still constitute a significant aspect of their valued culture today.

          1.8.1.5.2.1. Pro:
          The consumption of the French-Canadian Tourtière - a meat pie - on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve is still considered a treasured cultural tradition [854] by many.

            1.8.1.5.2.1.1. Con:
            There are vegetarian versions of a tourtière recipe. Here is one example [855].

      1.8.1.6. Pro:
      Western (European) culture began to undergo rapid changes starting with the arrival of Columbus in the New World [856], and continuing with the Industrial Revolution [857].

      1.8.1.7. Pro:
      Cultures around the world are undergoing transformation [858] due to environmental stresses, such as climate change [859].

        1.8.1.7.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.1.

    1.8.2. Con:
    In many cultures, a meatless diet plays an important cultural role.

      1.8.2.1. Pro:
      Ethiopian Christians [860] refrain from eating meat for 250 days of ever year.

      1.8.2.2. Pro:
      India has one of the lowest rates of annual meat consumption per head at about 10% [861] of the world's average. About 40% [862] of households eat a vegetarian diet.

        1.8.2.2.1. Pro:
        The roots of vegetarianism [863] in India go back to the introduction of Buddhism and Jainism in the sixth century BCE.

        1.8.2.2.2. Con:
        As poor countries grow richer and experience economic as well as cultural change, even in vegetarian-heavy places like India meat consumption is becoming more popular [864] and vegetarianism is falling out of favor [865].

          1.8.2.2.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.2.19.6.1.

      1.8.2.3. Pro:
      Vegetarian culture is prevalent in Taiwan due to the country's Buddhist heritage and visible in the popularity of vegetarian days [866] every week and strict food-labeling laws [867].

        1.8.2.3.1. Con:
        Although Taiwan has a strong vegetarian culture, its annual per-capita meat consumption has increased about four-fold since the country started to grow rich four decades ago (from 20kg [868] to almost 80kg [869]).

      1.8.2.4. Pro:
      Not harming animals [870] is also an important part of many cultures.

        1.8.2.4.1. Pro:
        Many Hindus [871] are vegetarian.

      1.8.2.5. Pro:
      According to the Biblical apocrypha original Christians were vegetarians (as well as alcohol abstainers). Article with multiple quotes [872] and a book [873] for reference.

      1.8.2.6. Con:
      Just like the formerly low rates of meat consumption in many of today's rich countries were driven by poverty and a lack of affordable meat rather than culture, so is vegetarianism in many developing countries more of an economic than a cultural reality. People would eat meat if only they could.

        1.8.2.6.1. Pro:
        In China, and especially in its rural parts, a meatless diet is oftentimes the result of poverty [874], not of cultral factors, religion, philosophy or politics.

        1.8.2.6.2. Pro:
        As India is growing richer and as its people have more disposable income, meat consumption is becoming more popular [875] and vegetarianism falling out of favor [876].

        1.8.2.6.3. Pro:
        -> See 1.8.2.3.1.

    1.8.3. Pro:
    In some cultures, it is logistically very difficult to follow a meatless diet.

      1.8.3.1. Pro:
      In some cultures, vegetarianism is socially stigmatized [877].

        1.8.3.1.1. Pro:
        In Japan, vegetarianism is neither [878] well-understood nor easily practiced socially without a burden.

          1.8.3.1.1.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.8.1.1.1.1.1.

        1.8.3.1.2. Pro:
        The vast majority of the world's population eats meat. By definition this makes non-meat eaters deviant.

          1.8.3.1.2.1. Con:
          Not all deviations are harmful or damaging, and some are sufficiently advantageous that they become the norm.

        1.8.3.1.3. Pro:
        In a study, six out of ten [879] former U.S. vegetarians and vegans stated that their diet made them "stick out from the crowd", and that this was a problem. Four out of ten current vegans and vegetarians state the same.

        1.8.3.1.4. Con:
        Social stigmas change all the time and may very well disappear.

          1.8.3.1.4.1. Con:
          That the stigma surrounding a meat-free lifestyle may disappear or lessen in the future does not change the stigmatised nature of its existence - and the problematic impact on those who live it - right now.

            1.8.3.1.4.1.1. Con:
            It is widely acknowledged that doing the right thing is not always easy.

          1.8.3.1.4.2. Pro:
          Abortions [880] were for a long time considered problematic. Women wanting abortion and providers were subject to stigma [881].

          1.8.3.1.4.3. Pro:
          In the past there was widepread social stigma towards the mentally ill. In most Western countries this is not the case anymore.

          1.8.3.1.4.4. Pro:
          This stigma may very well change in certain countries where veganism is on the rise. It might switch from "vegetarians/vegans" are weird, to "meat-eaters" are weird.

        1.8.3.1.5. Con:
        Most non-meat eaters do not suffer from being stigmatised as most people never know whether they eat meat or not.

          1.8.3.1.5.1. Pro:
          Today it is not odd if you order a vegetarian dish and people usually do not care about that.

            1.8.3.1.5.1.1. Con:
            This depends on the culture, context, and people involved. For example, vegans returning home for the holidays often face criticism [882] from non-vegan family members.

            1.8.3.1.5.1.2. Pro:
            -> See 1.7.3.6.2.

        1.8.3.1.6. Con:
        Today, especially young people (under the age of 55 [883]), would not describe non-meat eaters as deviant or odd.

          1.8.3.1.6.1. Pro:
          A growing trend towards meatless diet, vegetarianism as well as veganism has arisen among young people [884] due to their increasing awareness of health, the environment and compassion for animals.

            1.8.3.1.6.1.1. Con:
            -> See 1.8.2.2.2.

        1.8.3.1.7. Pro:
        The emergence of the vegetarian movement and belief was perceived as threatening [885] to their initial lifestyle by some people. This caused a backlash which led to aversion.

          1.8.3.1.7.1. Con:
          Those perceptions of a threat are subjective and unfounded, thus they can not serve as a tolerable reason for developing an aversion as a backlash.

            1.8.3.1.7.1.1. Pro:
            The vegetarian movement does not openly condemn meateaters or propagate a universal meatless diet. Vegetarianism is simply the individual practice of people from voluntarily abstaining from the consumption of meat. Thus it does not pose any comprehensible threat.

              1.8.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con:
              The vegetarian movement is not an entirely unified whole, and there are significant numbers of vegetarians and vegans who attract ire by criticizing, accosting or accusing meat-eaters for their dietary preferences.

          1.8.3.1.7.2. Pro:
          According to existentialism [886] the pure existence of something, in this case an ideological group which refuses to consume meat, can be perceived as a threat to the own convictions, values and thus to the own existence (way of life).

          1.8.3.1.7.3. Con:
          In the same way, meateaters' insensibility towards animals as well as their incomprehension towards vegetarians' belief and free choice can be perceived as threatening by non-meateaters.

            1.8.3.1.7.3.1. Con:
            This is nothing but an offensive cliche.

          1.8.3.1.7.4. Con:
          Every change is seen as threatening by some people, whether they will be personally affected or not. This is not an argument not to change things or have movements directed at specific goals, otherwise we would have to never do that.

        1.8.3.1.8. Pro:
        In parts of countries like China pure meatless diet still carries the stigma of poverty [887].

      1.8.3.2. Con:
      The general trend shows meatless [888] diet is on the rise all over the world.

        1.8.3.2.1. Con:
        The number of vegetarians in Germany declined [889] since 2013.

          1.8.3.2.1.1. Con:
          Regarding the number of vegetarians in Germany, divided by their age, vegetarianism will grow in the next years, as many young people turn vegetarian [890].

        1.8.3.2.2. Pro:
        In Britain [891] one in eight adults now follows a vegetarian or vegan diet. While 12% of the total population has decided to ditch meat, that percentage jumps to 20% for people between the ages of 16 and 24.

        1.8.3.2.3. Pro:
        In 2014 the Indian city Palitana became the first all-vegetarian [892] city in the world, after the Gujarat government imposed a ban on animal slaughter and outlawed the sale of meat and eggs.

        1.8.3.2.4. Con:
        Across the world per capita meat consumption has been steadily rising [893] and will continue to do so at least until 2030.

        1.8.3.2.5. Con:
        -> See 1.8.2.2.2.

        1.8.3.2.6. Pro:
        The share of all food and drink product launches with a claim to be vegetarian has doubled [894] from 2009 to 2013 in Great Britain (from 6% to 12%).

        1.8.3.2.7. Con:
        -> See 1.2.19.6.

        1.8.3.2.8. Con:
        The demand for meat is rising globally. This clearly indicates its high popularity.

          1.8.3.2.8.1. Con:
          Vegetarianism has increased in a number of countries over the last 5 years.

            1.8.3.2.8.1.1. Pro:
            The number of vegetarians in NZ [895] (of those 14 years or older) increased from 8.1% in 2011 to 10.3% in 2015.

            1.8.3.2.8.1.2. Pro:
            Between 2012 and 2016, the percentage of Australians whose diet is all or almost all vegetarian has risen from 9.7% of the population to 11.2%. [896]

            1.8.3.2.8.1.3. Pro:
            In 2014, the UK reported that a record number of British adults were following vegetarian or vegan diets [897], with numbers estimated at around 12% of the population.

          1.8.3.2.8.2. Con:
          The raise of demand of a product does not necessarily indicate it has a higher popularity. It could indicate the lack of the product, the increase of the customer or any other factor that could unbalance the demand versus offer balance.

            1.8.3.2.8.2.1. Con:
            Demand and supply are different, a decrease of supply is not called an increase in demand, it's called a decrease in supply, an increase in consumption and prices signals higher demand, a decrease in both, lower demand, an increase in consumption but decrease in price marks lower supply, and the opposite a shortage of supply. But a raise in popularity is literally a rise in demand.

            1.8.3.2.8.2.2. Con:
            Not "necessarily" but a pretty good inference.

            1.8.3.2.8.2.3. Pro:
            Meat consumption is related to living standards. This could explain the rising of demand: the more developing countries develop the more meat is demanded. data.oecd.org [898]

          1.8.3.2.8.3. Pro:
          Steak (beef) and chicken are ranked very highly [899] among the world's favorite foods.

            1.8.3.2.8.3.1. Con:
            Just because something is ranked very highly doesn't make it ethical or justify its lack of morality.

          In the USA meat consumption is actually on the decline [900]. It decreased from 184 pounds per person in 2004 to 167 pounds in 2014.

            1.8.3.2.8.7.1. Pro:
            Especially, the consumption of red meat [901] is on a decline.

            1.8.3.2.8.7.2. Con:
            This citation focuses on specific dates to justify their "peak meat" claims. Other analysis has shown that 2014 was just one of many short term troughs before meat consumption jumped right back up to historic high levels  has.

            1.8.3.2.8.7.3. Con:
            Meat consumption in the US is not declining because the taste of meat is falling out of favor, but because of [902] rising awareness about the health and environmental risks of eating meat, and rising prices.

        -> See 1.8.3.2.8.7.

      1.8.3.3. Con:
      As a meatless diet does not restrict people in any common social situations it cannot be insociable.

        1.8.3.3.2. Con:
        Non-meat eaters oftentimes require special effort from the hosts of social gatherings. Asking for this effort can make things uncomfortable for them, just as not making this effort can make things uncomfortable for hosts, as Michael Pollan described [904].

          1.8.3.3.2.1. Con:
          People with certain food allergies/intolerances also require special effort from the host. This does not make things uncomfortable in any way.

            1.8.3.3.2.1.1. Con:
            Vegetarianism is seen as a conscious choice; allergies and intolerances are not.

              1.8.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
              There are quite a few food allergy fakers [905] that pass off diets and dislikes as medical conditions.

                1.8.3.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                “Some see it as the answer to losing weight, or something that will force them to do so,” says nutritionist Lauren Schmitt [906]. Allergies or intolerances are the perfect reason to not eat a food, especially when trying to lose weight.

                1.8.3.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                In order to justify e.g. a gluten-free lifestyle, many people claim that they have a gluten allergy (or even allergies to dairy, sugar or eggs) so they can eliminate entire food groups from their diet.

                1.8.3.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con:
                To the observer this does not matter (assuming she is not aware of the fake-ness). Allergies still seem like a less voluntary restriction than vegetarianism.

          1.8.3.3.2.2. Con:
          A good host wants the event to be a wonderful experience for all the guests. For him/her it will thus not be a special effort to consider the guests' preferences, it will be his/her pleasure.

        1.8.3.3.3. Pro:
        Vegetarians can without any major problem join dinner invitations, parties and all kinds of social events.

      1.8.3.4. Pro:
      In many countries, restaurants often serve not a variety of dishes, but variants of a single dish. If this dish is not meatless, it either excludes vegetarians, or requires groups with 1 or more vegetarians among them to actively avoid these restaurants when eating out, restricting choice on social venues for all involved.

        1.8.3.4.3. Con:
        There are many meat eaters which have certain food preferences and will not ever eat certain dishes. However nobody would say they are unsociable because of that.

          1.8.3.4.3.1. Con:
          Few other food preferences are as widely exclusive as is a meatless diet. Being on a meatless diet is thus on a different level than merely disliking certain ingredients.

            1.8.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
            A gluten [907]-free diet is as exclusive as a meatless diet, as one could not eat anything including wheat and related grains.

            1.8.3.4.3.1.2. Con:
            There are far more staple ingredients in cuisine around the world than meat. Onion, for example, is the world's most ubiquitous [908] foodstuff, "the only truly global ingredient"; eating an onion-less diet would come as a much more major and daily obstacle than a meatless one.

              1.8.3.4.3.1.2.1. Con:
              Onions rarely carry cultural importance, as opposed to eating meat. [909]

          1.8.3.4.3.2. Pro:
          Some people hate the lingering odor of onions and especially garlic and would not eat any meals including these ingredients.

          1.8.3.4.3.3. Pro:
          Some people dislike the (hot) spices used in Asian cuisine and thus avoid food from e.g. Korea, Thailand, China etc.

          1.8.3.4.3.4. Pro:
          Quite a few people consistently avoid meals including gluten, lactose or sugar for dietary reasons.

            1.8.3.4.3.4.1. Con:
            These people may have allergies or intolerances and are thus forced to avoid certain meals.

      1.8.3.5. Pro:
      In many countries - for example China, Japan. and Korea [910] - meatless diets are not widely popular and recognized, hence maintaining a meatless diet is not entirely feasible.

          1.8.3.5.2.1. Pro:
          Vegetarianism in Korea is becoming a new trend [911] with online communities sharing information.

            1.8.3.5.2.1.1. Pro:
            There are 50 [912] purely vegetarian restaurants in Seoul and 150 [913] across the country.

            The Korean Vegetarian Union believes 1 percent [914] of the population are vegetarians.

          1.8.3.5.2.2. Pro:
          According to a 2014 survey 4.7 percent [915] of the Japanese population are vegetarian. This is only a bit lower than in Western countries.

            1.8.3.5.2.2.1. Pro:
            And these are only the numbers on strict vegetarians who not only do not eat meat, but also do not eat fish and seafood. The number for non-meateaters should thus be even higher.

          1.8.3.5.2.3. Pro:
          Estimates suggest that  4 or 5 percent [916] of Chinese could be vegetarian.

            1.8.3.5.2.3.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.8.3.5.2.2.1.

          1.8.3.5.2.4. Con:
          These numbers tell us very little about the circumstances and difficulties these non-meat eaters face.

            1.8.3.5.2.4.1. Pro:
            By the same logic, the estimated 5% [917] of China's population that are Christians would not face many problems. Yet more than half of them are organized in semi-legal underground churches, which exemplifies the difficulties they face.

              1.8.3.5.2.4.1.1. Con:
              Vegetarianism is in no way legally prescribed in Korea. Thus, the comparison to Christians in China is flawed.

              1.8.3.5.2.4.1.2. Con:
              Roughly 5% [918] of Indonesians do own a car and they do not face problems. Selecting any 5% population to show non-meat eaters statistics are flawed is, at least, equally flawed.

              1.8.3.5.2.4.1.3. Con:
              The difference between Christianity and Vegetarism is that one is an optional thing of belief, whereas the other concerns the intake of food, which is necessary for surviving. The two cannot be compared.

                1.8.3.5.2.4.1.3.1. Con:
                They can certainly be compared, as the original claim compares them on the grounds of both being minority and sometimes persecuted opinions and factions.

            1.8.3.5.2.4.2. Con:
            If many non-meat eaters are living in a place it can be assumed that it is easier than if fewer non-meat eaters live in that place.

          1.8.3.5.2.5. Pro:
          There is an own vegetarian subculture active in Seoul that expresses itself in magazines [919] and connects in this way.

          1.8.3.5.2.6. Pro:
          The main staple dishes in Korea, rice and kimchi, are produced without meat.

        1.8.3.5.3. Pro:
        In Korean schools [920] there are no meatless dishes offered for children.

        1.8.3.5.4. Con:
        There is a long history of vegetarian food in East Asian countries through the influence of Buddhism, which tends to lack meat.

          1.8.3.5.4.1. Pro:
          A meat based diet is seen as a westernized cuisine while a plant based diet is indigenous.

            1.8.3.5.4.1.1. Pro:
            In Japan [921] the Americanization of the indigenous diet caused a strong rise in meat consumption.

            1.8.3.5.4.1.2. Pro:
            In Korea [922], it was only with modernization that meat consumption increased drastically.

            1.8.3.5.4.1.3. Con:
            -> See 1.2.5.6.1.5.9.4.1.

          1.8.3.5.4.2. Con:
          Barely anyone outside of Buddhist temples and monasteries lives according to a Buddhist diet.

            1.8.3.5.4.2.1. Pro:
            Buddhism's basic code of ethics for laypeople - the Five Precepts [923] - does not contain any dietary restrictions but merely prohibits the active participation [924] in killing. Outside of temples and monasteries a vegetarian diet is thus not required from Buddhists.

          1.8.3.5.4.3. Con:
          Buddhism does [925], depending on the school, not advocate a vegetarian diet, and generally not expect laypeople to refrain from eating meat.

            1.8.3.5.4.3.1. Pro:
            -> See 1.8.3.5.4.2.1.

        1.8.3.5.5. Pro:
        At celebrations for the Chinese New Year [926] and Korean Chuseok [927] it is traditionally necessary to offer meat dishes as ritual foods.

        1.8.3.5.6. Con:
        Korean cuisine hosts a variety of non-meat dishes that are widely available, such as Kimchi, Bibimbap, Gimbap, Mandu, Bam, Gamja Jon, Doenjang Jigae, Jap chae, or Jamchi Jigae.

        -> See 1.7.3.6.3.

        1.8.3.5.9. Pro:
        It's nearly impossible to live off a vegetarian diet in some areas, like Tibet [928].

        1.8.3.5.10. Pro:
        Traditional restaurants in these countries oftentimes focus on a single, meat-containing dish and offer nothing besides, for example in Japan [929].

          1.8.3.5.10.1. Con:
          Many of such single-dish restaurants focus on dishes like sushi, tempura, okonomiyaki or noodles (udon, soba or ramen), which are generally meatless.

          1.8.3.5.10.2. Con:

      1.8.3.6. Con:
      -> See 1.8.3.4.3.

      1.8.3.7. Con:
      People with certain food allergies / intolerances (Coeliac disease [930], lactose intolerance [931], histamine intolerance, nut allergies etc.) will not ever eat certain dishes, but noone would say they are insociable because of that.

        1.8.3.7.1. Con:
        -> See 1.8.3.3.2.1.1.

      1.8.3.8. Con:
      The solution to this would be to minimize the stigmatization and increase the availability of meatless diets, not embrace eating meat.

      1.8.3.9. Con:
      Among all cultures there are people who do not eat certain kinds of meat for religious reasons [932] and they do not seem to be stigmatized as insociable.

        1.8.3.9.1. Pro:
        You cannot prepare pork or meat that is not halal for your Muslim friends for example.

        1.8.3.9.2. Pro:
        You cannot prepare any meat for your Hinduist friends.

          1.8.3.9.2.1. Con:
          The ancient and medieval Hindu texts [933] do not explicitly prohibit eating meat.

        1.8.3.9.3. Pro:
        You cannot prepare pork or any meat that is not kosher for your Jewish friends.

    1.8.4. Pro:
    Many religions explicitly permit or encourage eating animals.

      1.8.4.1. Pro:
      According to Mormonism, God created animals for our use, to eat sparingly [934].

        1.8.4.1.1. Con:
        Eating or abusing someone is harmful to their life experience. If any living beings were created with the intention of being eaten and abused, this would indicate that God did not consider their lives to be precious. There is no purpose to the creation of living beings whose lives are not precious.

          1.8.4.1.1.1. Con:
          Life, including animal life, is sacred. The Creator permits the sacrifice of animal life in order to save human life, but He will require the lives of beasts at our hands. [935]

      1.8.4.2. Con:
      Biblical citations and religious assertions alone are not reasoned evidence.

      1.8.4.3. Pro:
      As this is a moral statement, with no declarable moral code defined, the Bible even from a atheistic view is valid here. For example,  (Romans 14): "As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. 2 One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. 3 Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him."

        1.8.4.3.1. Con:
        By many forms of moral reasoning (e.g. utilitarianism), God is amoral or even sometimes commits evil acts. As such, the Bible does not provide an unambiguous view of goodness.

      1.8.4.4. Con:
      No religion mandates eating animals.

      1.8.4.5. Pro:
      In the Bible, God granted the animals to Noah and his family after the flood, saying "The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green plant. Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."

      1.8.4.6. Pro:
      Meat was created by God for the righteous use of all of us, his children. The scriptures are eloquent, clear, and common sense on this topic. 1st Timothy Chapter 4 Verses 1-16 [936]

        1.8.4.6.1. Con:
        Meat is, by one definition, the organs or tissues of animals considered to be food. Organs and tissues of living beings were created for the functioning of an individual's living processes, perceptions and actions and not for the nutritional purposes of other animals, including humans.

      1.8.4.7. Pro:
      In the Bible, God tells Adam and Eve not only to have dominion over all animals, but he also gives instruction in the mosaic law as to what types of animals you can and can’t eat. There are dozens more religions that promote certain diets that include meat.

        1.8.4.7.1. Con:
        -> See 1.8.2.5.

      1.8.4.8. Con:
      Jainism encourages vegetarianism on the basis of ahimsa which is the principle of nonviolence and noninjury and is, in the case of Jains, applied to all beings.

      1.8.4.9. Con:
      If God created some living beings subservient to others, this would indicate God doesn't care about the welfare of some of his creations.

        1.8.4.9.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.8.4.1.1.

      1.8.4.10. Con:
      An omnibenevolent God would not create living beings that have the capacity to suffer with the purpose of being eaten and abused which results in suffering.

      1.8.4.11. Pro:
      If the temple in Jerusalem ever gets rebuilt, there will be a need of sacrifices there. That involves killing animals.

    1.8.5. Pro:
    -> See 1.3.9.3.1.9.2.1.1.7.

    1.8.6. Con:
    A deliberate cultural evolution away from meat will overcome many current cultural issues with not eating meat.

    1.8.7. Con:
    Once a culture has the resources and technological knowhow to live in a way that avoids harms it previously needed for survival, that culture permanently progresses. Other cultures may have a valid argument for consuming meat or other ESS [937] such as raids involving murder of rival tribes' members. Western culture, with its great abundance and alternate foods, does not.

    1.8.8. Pro:
    In the most world-renowned cuisines, meat plays a central part and is often the highlight dish.

      1.8.8.1. Con:
      When meat is the main focus of a meal, it is often marinated, covered in sauces, seasonings, cheese, and vegetables to enhance its taste. It is those things that are delicious, not the meat itself.

        1.8.8.1.1. Con:
        People who order their steak rare enjoy the flavor of the actual meat.

        1.8.8.1.2. Pro:
        Meat has become much less flavourful [938] since the introduction - and subsequent rise - of factory-farming.

          1.8.8.1.2.1. Pro:
          The flavour of meat is heavily influenced by what the animal primarily ate [939] during its lifetime; studies show that meat of which the corresponding animal fed on natural pastures and not on man-made grain mixes is more flavourful, thus the rise of factory-farming has meant that meat is, on the whole, blander.

        1.8.8.1.3. Con:
        The texture of meat more then the flavor is what most people value, and it's hard to replicate.

          1.8.8.1.3.1. Con:
          While this argument may be true to people who eat nothing other than bad steak and chicken breast, others will find all parts of a carcass to be immensely valuable for all sorts of reasons. For example, stock is essential to good cooking as a consequence, consuming meat doesn't necessarily involve chewing.

        1.8.8.1.4. Con:
        Meat is usually not seasoned apart from salt. It is only processed meat that needs seasoning.

        1.8.8.1.5. Con:
        Bacon tastes amazing and is very rarely seasoned.

          1.8.8.1.5.1. Con:
          Bacon is cured. In the curing process significant amounts of salt are used negating the need to season later.

        1.8.8.1.6. Con:
        This argument is based off an assumption. Flavour and texture of meat is something that only a meat-eater can attest to. It is opinion based and thus can't be refuted logically, merely subjectively, which can't be a basis for rational argument.

          1.8.8.1.6.1. Con:
          This implies that claims relating to the flavour or texture of meat should become an unassailable argument in favour of eating meat. This is not good debating form.

      1.8.8.2. Pro:
      If eating meat is too far abandoned before artificial replacements can suitably be found, culinary arts developed over centuries may be lost.

        1.8.8.2.1. Pro:
        It only takes a few generations to forget how to cook.

      1.8.8.3. Con:
      Something being tasty does not justify torturing animals or destroying the environment. Jeffrey Dahmer used humans as the central piece of his meals. Protecting that culinary option for him was not more important than protecting the lives of those he would destroy.

        1.8.8.3.1. Con:
        It's not only about it being tasty. The point is that you can not, at the same time, stop consuming meat and preserve the culture and identity of the people cooking and enjoying these dishes.

      1.8.8.4. Con:
      Culinary styles and traditions change and evolve over time. If the world stops eating meat, international cuisines will adapt to that fact.

        1.8.8.4.1. Con:
        True, humans will try to find ways to make their food enjoyable no matter what they eat. However, the sum of all the cultures and traditions that would get lost in the process is invaluable.

      1.8.8.5. Con:
      Most world-renowned cuisines developed seasoning and preparations to make up for the lack of meat or mask the deficiencies of poor quality scraps. What makes them world renowned is not the meat ingredients, it's everything else around it.

      1.8.8.6. Pro:
      Bacon. Whenever there is a debate about not eating meat, bacon is quite a strong argument for the case that eating meat brings more taste and pleasure than most plant based foods.

        1.8.8.6.1. Con:
        Bacon has become memetic in some circles. Memes do not necessarily correspond to reality, as exaggeration is socially encouraged for entertainment.

        1.8.8.6.2. Con:
        Speaking from personal experience, when I ate meat I did not like bacon. Others, both meat-eaters and vegetarians, have said the same. It may a pleasurable taste to you but that experience is not universal.

      1.8.8.7. Con:
      An increase in vegetarianism would generate newer and better vegetarian foods, recipes and cooking techniques, which could rival the pleasure generated from meat-based meals.

      1.8.8.8. Con:
      Maybe it is not because it's the tastiest food, it could also be that it is the most exclusive, expensive and a symbol of power and wealth.

      1.8.8.9. Con:
      There is no necessary correlation between a particular cuisine, restaurant or dish's level of prestige and whether it includes meat or not.

        1.8.8.9.1. Pro:
        The Michelin guide recommends [940] plenty of vegetarian restaurants; there are more meat-serving restaurants listed simply because they appeal to a larger pool of potential guests.

        1.8.8.9.2. Con:
        Regardless of whether the correlation between prestigious cuisine and meat inclusion is necessary, it exists in the minds of many: chef and owner of Brighton's reputable Silo restaurant, Douglas McMaster, still cooks meat at his restaurant despite being vegetarian as meat usage is “deeply engrained into fine dining cooking” [941].

        1.8.8.9.3. Pro:
        A study [942] suggests that it is not specific ingredients that weigh most heavily on a cuisine's reputation at all, but its combinations of different flavours at a molecular level: the study indicates that the universal popularity of cuisines such as Indian comes not from its usage (or non-usage) of certain ingredients like meat, but from its combining of certain ingredients whose flavour compounds do not significantly overlap.

        1.8.8.9.4. Pro:
        Maghreb cuisine is reportedly highly reputable among the upper-class of Paris, featured on culinary blogs [943] particularly for its exquisite (and, by chance, vegetarian) cous cous dishes.

        1.8.8.9.5. Pro:
        The signature dish of one of the most famous chefs of all time, Paul Bocuse [944], is a vegetarian truffle soup.

        1.8.8.9.6. Con:
        In the 2015 iteration of the "World’s 50 Best Restaurants [945]" ranking by the British magazine Restaurant, only a single entry makes any reference to vegetarian cuisine (#50 [946]).

        1.8.8.9.7. Con:
        In a high cuisine full course dinner [947] fish and meat are the central courses.

    1.8.9. Con:
    Culture explains behavior but does not necessarily justify it.

      1.8.9.1. Pro:
      The fact that eating meat is natural or inherent to human culture does not imply that we ought to eat it. According to Hume, it is a fallacy to make claims about what ought to be [948] ("we ought to eat meat") on the basis of statements about what is ("it is natural to eat meat").

        1.8.9.1.1. Con:
        'What is' is a better indicator than philosophical thoughts on 'what ought to be' because it has shown its applicability.

          1.8.9.1.1.1. Con:
          Every progressive change throughout history involved people collectively taking action to change "what is" in favor of their view of "what ought to be".
          
          So if we look at "what is", we discover that it *is* the case that there exists an extensive proven track record of successful cases where "what ought to be" has led to positive cultural change that we value today.
          
          So by this point's own reasoning, we should therefore take "what ought to be" seriously.

        1.8.9.1.2. Con:
        Humans ought to do what it is in their nature to do.

          1.8.9.1.2.1. Con:
          What is "human nature" is widely debated.

          1.8.9.1.2.2. Con:
          This could be argued to include any result of conscious, deliberated choices - such as not eating meat. Humans are also social animals, so social consensus decisions could also be argued to be part of "human nature".

          1.8.9.1.2.3. Con:
          No. A bully beating up a weaker kid to feel powerful is acting according to human nature too. Gorging on high-calorie food is acting according to human nature. Human nature is sometimes good, sometimes evil. Morality must be sensitive to human nature, true. But the entire reason we need morality as a subject of study is that *sound* moral reasoning doesn't come naturally to us.

        1.8.9.1.3. Pro:
        Additionally, we should seek to get the relationship between what is *normative* and what is *normal* the right way around. The normative should dictate what is normal. Just because an act is normal does not in and of itself signify that the act is therefore good, just, beautiful, or useful.

        1.8.9.1.4. Con:
        One philosopher should not dictate what the entirety of human existence inherently desires.

        1.8.9.1.5. Pro:
        The cultural basis for meat consumption originated in hunter gatherer times. We no longer live in hunter gather societies and therefore dietary custom is an antiquated justification for meat consumption. Hunter gatherer meat consumption is more justified than agrarian meat consumption because meat was a scarcity that had to be earned; consequently it was the highlight of the meal. The amount of meat consumed is unnatural and is therefore at odds with the foundation of this cultural argument.

      1.8.9.2. Pro:
      "Culture" is not important. Cultural behaviors can be positive or negative. The practice of female genital mutilation is not something we should strive to protect simply because it is part of the culture. Slavery was our culture once. People fought and died to preserve that culture, yet the culture was wrong, just as the culture of eating animal products is.

      1.8.9.3. Pro:
      Culture should not dictate morality.

      1.8.9.4. Pro:
      -> See 1.8.9.1.5.

      1.8.9.5. Pro:
      -> See 1.2.3.4.1.1.

      1.8.9.6. Pro:
      Not all cultural or religious values should be respected.  They are not equally valid.

      1.8.9.7. Pro:
      People live traditionally and rarely stop to ask whether our traditions are blinding us from the reality of the cruel way we indirectly treat certain animals. At the root of their treatment is discrimination, which leads to exploitation and abuse. Eating animals in the modern world is cruel because it is no longer necessary to eat animals to survive and live a healthy life. If these animals we not bred into existence, there would be no need for them to exist in the wild.

      1.8.9.8. Pro:
      Eating meat was necessary for survival. Many meat-eating cultures have some inherent respect for the animals they eat. If there is no longer a necessity to eat meat to survive, the slaughter is purely for gratification; we should reduce our consumption, and develop other ways of fulfilling our recreational eating desires.

      1.8.9.9. Con:
      More humans eat meat than choose to abstain from eating meat, and most abstention is poverty based. Whilst non-meat eaters are the more vocal and empassioned cohort on this issue, this does not make them the majority and societal intersubjective truths are generally determined by majority thought constructs. In other words, eating meats is okay because most humans believe it to be okay.

      1.8.9.10. Con:
      It's not ethically wrong since the definition of "Ethical" is "A set of moral values and principles that guide the human conduct in the society". Knowing that, the most part of the society eat meat and don't see any problem in this. We can declare it not ethically wrong.Ethical Definition ( Brazil Website ) [949]

      1.8.9.11. Pro:
      The argument that something is part of a dominant culture was used to justify numerous evils of human history, from racism to corruption and the suppression of minorities.

        1.8.9.11.1. Pro:
        In the past people were presented to gods as human sacrifices [950] or held as slaves [951]. However, these cruel features were eventually abandoned in most cultures.

          1.8.9.11.1.1. Con:
          Slavery [952] and human sacrifices [953] exist as of today.

      1.8.9.12. Con:
      As there are no absolute standards for judging right and wrong, good and bad, as these terms are products of social agreement, individuals can only use their culture and the values / attitudes it has created for moral guidance. From this point of view, the dominant culture thus explains and justifies behavior.

        1.8.9.12.1. Con:
        Moral relativism is self-defeating in this case. Suppose all cultures should follow their own ethical codes. It then follows that if our culture's code says that eating meat is unethical, then we should condemn everyone who eats meat, no matter what culture they are from.

        1.8.9.12.2. Con:
        Some cultural practices are obviously wrong. For example, slavery and torture are wrong, even if most people once thought they were right. So there are some universal moral standards that exist independently of cultural opinion.

        1.8.9.12.3. Con:
        -> See 1.5.7.1.1.

        1.8.9.12.4. Con:
        The fundamental moral truth, that pain and suffering in living beings should be minimized as much as possible, has to be the foundation of any discussion and has to supersede cultural values. Otherwise things like slavery and ritual killings would need to be considered morally OK, just because they are part of a certain culture. This would make argument-/logic-based discussions about what is morally right/wrong pointless. Thus, if such a discussion shall take place, culture can't be an argument.

        1.8.9.12.5. Pro:
        All humans are a part of a certain culture and society, which fundamentally characterizes their values and attitudes. Thus behavior of a certain culture can only be judged in comparison.

        1.8.9.12.6. Con:
        According to moral universalism [954], a system of ethics applies universally, that is, for all individuals, regardless of culture.

        1.8.9.12.7. Pro:
        According to meta-ethical moral relativism [955] in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong.

          1.8.9.12.7.1. Pro:
          Because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.

          1.8.9.12.7.2. Con:
          According to moral absolutism [956], particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong.

            1.8.9.12.7.2.1. Con:
            According to cultural relativism [957], judgement of right and wrong are determined by one's own culture and are thus not absolute.

              1.8.9.12.7.2.1.1. Con:
              Cultural relativism contradicts itself by arguing that moral principles are culturally dependent, and that we should therefore not impose our morality on others, because, the principle "we should not impose our morality on others" is not culturally dependent.

              1.8.9.12.7.2.1.2. Con:
              There are moral systems which can exist and be applied independently of culture, e.g. utilitarianism.

          1.8.9.12.7.3. Pro:
          According to the epistemological position of "fallibilism [958]", absolute certainty about knowledge is impossible.

      1.8.9.13. Pro:
      -> See 1.8.9.12.7.2.

      1.8.9.14. Con:
      The amounts of culturally-prescribed meat, for example at rituals, are limited and thus come with marginal negative effects. There is nothing to justify.

        1.8.9.14.1. Con:
        Justification is not a question of amount. If something is wrong, it is wrong regardless of the quantity in which it occurs: murdering one person is wrong, as is murdering five people.

        1.8.9.14.2. Pro:
        There are only several occasions per year, such as on Eid al-Adha [959], that eating meat is culturally induced.

"The small scale of current cultured meat production requires a relatively high use of energy and therefore carbon emissions. But once scaled up its manufacturers say it will produce much lower emissions and use far less water and land than conventional meat."

A lack of vitamin B12 can lead to serious health consequences, such as pernicious anemia."

"What made them return to their omnivorous ways? Reasons fell into one of five categories: health, hassle, cravings, social and ethical. A full thirty-five percent of participants indicated that declining health was the main reason they reverted back to eating flesh. To quote one participant, "I was very weak and sickly. I felt horrible even though I ate a good variety of foods like PETA said to." Another states, "My doctor recommended that I eat some form of meat as I was not getting any better. I thought it would be hypocritical of me to just eat chicken and fish as they are just as much an animal as a cow or pig. So I went from no meat to all meat." One particularly blunt fellow said, "I will take a dead cow over anemia any time.""

"As we saw -one- Kant was not vegan. And -two- Kant reserves the enablement of the categorical imperative to reasonable beings alone, meaning beings who not only act according to laws (which, for example, a stone can do when falling from a cliff face into the valley below), but that also have the ability to act in accordance with representations of laws. This means being capable of subjecting their own will to principles. No rocks, no plants, and, in his mind, no animals."
[357] https://sawer.medium.com/kant-the-vegan-3cf0b6420913
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

"Thus, they probably obtained meat mainly via “persistence hunting”—chasing an antelope, for instance, until it was nearly keeling over with heat exhaustion—and scavenging. The latter was very much a running game: When distant, circling vultures tipped them off about a lion kill, they had to get there before hyenas, which strip everything edible from carcasses. And they typically could only outrace hyenas in the hot sun. As a result, they carved out a new carnivore niche: the hot-day meat chaser."

"Antibiotics are administered to animals in feed to marginally improve growth rates and to prevent infections, a practice projected to increase dramatically worldwide over the next 15 years. There is growing evidence that antibiotic resistance in humans is promoted by the widespread use of nontherapeutic antibiotics in animals. Resistant bacteria are transmitted to humans through direct contact with animals, by exposure to animal manure, through consumption of undercooked meat, and through contact with uncooked meat or surfaces meat has touched."

"First off, let me start by saying that vitamin B12 is incredibly important for formation of red blood cells and healthy functioning of the brain and nervous system. And regardless of diet, everyone should be taking a multivitamin that includes B12 for optimal health. But this vitamin is mainly found in animal products—so you may find yourself wondering about vegan sources of vitamin B12.

Well, you’ve come to the right place. You can find this vitamin in some plant-based foods, including many that you may not realize are fortified with vitamin B12."

"Technically speaking, to beg the question is not a logical fallacy. This is because it is logically valid, in the strictest sense, but it is utterly unpersuasive. The thing that you are trying to prove is already assumed to be true, so you are not actually adding anything to the argument. It would be like saying a product is the most expensive because it has the highest price."
