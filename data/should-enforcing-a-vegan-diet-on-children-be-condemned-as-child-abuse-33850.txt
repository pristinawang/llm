Discussion Name:
Should enforcing a vegan diet on children be condemned as child abuse?

1. Thesis:
Enforcing a vegan diet on children must be condemned as child abuse.

  1.1. Pro:
  Children should be able to choose what they want, even if guided by parents, it should still be their choice. Therefore forcing them into veganism should be classified as child abuse because of freedom of choice laws since the decision to go vegan is not directly helping the child.

    1.1.1. Con:
    Parents have a right to decide what food is allowed and not in their house.

  1.2. Con:
  Encouraging a society to invest in humane agriculture, educating parents about already existing morally acceptable animal sources of foods for their children could be more effective than shaming.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    Shaming others for lifestyle choices has been proven to do much more harm [1] than good in the majority of cases.

  1.3. Pro:
  There are considerable health risks for children who follow a vegan diet.

    1.3.1. Pro:
    Providing adequate supplementation for a child is extremely difficult for the majority of families. A plant-based diet does not naturally provide everything that a child needs to develop, so parents must add various supplements [2].

      1.3.1.1. Con:
      Parents who can't afford to provide their children with a vegan diet are unlikely to force it on them.

    1.3.2. Con:
    A certain diet is not abusive if the outcome is that the child thrives. Provided sufficient care is taken, a vegan diet can support normal growth and development [3] of children.

      1.3.2.1. Pro:
      The (US) National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System measure pediatric obesity markers [4] and caution the obesity link to a child's failure to thrive, that is they measure an outcome of diet (i.e. obese or not obese) as opposed to the child's type of diet. (i.e. Standard American Diet, Vegetarian, Vegan, Paleo, etc)

    1.3.3. Con:
    Vegetarian and vegan diets can be healthy [5], but they can lack certain nutrients. You may have to use a little creativity to ensure you get enough protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B12. You can find many of these nutrients in eggs and dairy if you're vegetarian, and from plant sources if you're vegan. So, this source from Harvard shows how it is possible to still live a full and healthy life on vegan/vegetarian diets.

      1.3.3.1. Pro:
      Vegetables [6] are known to provide sufficient vitamins and minerals for a child's development and growth in certain areas of life.

    1.3.4. Con:
    Many other foods and diets currently followed also carry significant health risks for children.

      1.3.4.1. Pro:
      The Standard American Diet contributes to higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but it is not classified as child abuse, so the mere potential for harm due to nutritional deficiencies is not a reason to classify enforced veganism as child abuse.

    1.3.5. Con:
    As long as parents have good nutritional knowledge, no health risk [7] has been found for children following a vegan diet.

    1.3.6. Pro:
    A vegan diet may put children at a heightened risk [8] of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential amino acids. This can lead to health complications.

      1.3.6.1. Pro:
      If a child becomes deficient in vitamin D and calcium, their bones do not develop healthily and strongly, and they can develop the bone disorder Rickets [9].

      1.3.6.2. Pro:
      A study conducted by the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a higher fracture risk [10] in vegans as compared with any other diet, which could suggest that vegan diets make people more susceptible to calcium deficiency.

        1.3.6.2.1. Con:
        The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition study was not on children but on adults aged 20-89.

        1.3.6.2.2. Con:
        The Journal concluded that the reason for more fractures in vegans could possibly be a lack of calcium, a mineral which aids bone density. However, many plant foods such as kale, broccoli and soy have high levels of easily absorbed calcium. This suggests that the issue may be less the content of a plant-based diet, and more a lack of awareness among vegans surrounding the importance of consuming calcium-rich vegan foods [11].

      1.3.6.3. Con:
      Babies and young children on a vegan diet [12] can get the energy and most of the nutrients they need to grow and develop from a well-planned varied and balanced diet.

      1.3.6.4. Con:
      Ruminants grown for meat production often themselves are low in B12 [13], which is then added to feed or injected before slaughter.

        1.3.6.4.1. Con:
        There are multiple [14] ways to prevent or treat cobalt deficiency in ruminants before slaughter, thus their meat still likely presents a good source of vitamin B12 for humans.

      1.3.6.5. Con:
      Heme iron [15], the type found predominantly in blood and muscle, can be absorbed better than the non-heme iron that predominates in plants, but may increase the risk of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome.

      1.3.6.6. Con:
      Whole plant diets are healthier and pose less risk for children [16] than a diet with meat & dairy which can introduce harmful pollutant compounds.

    1.3.7. Con:
    Children [17] more often thrive on a vegan diet as there are fewer risks associated with it than the 'standard American (Western) diet' (SAD), especially when high in whole plant foods and low in processed/packaged items.

    1.3.8. Con:
    "It is the position [18] of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes."

    1.3.9. Pro:
    Parents are usually not aware of the long term health consequences [19] that a certain diet would have on their children either, so they should not be able to enforce diets that are not recommended by specialized physicians.

  1.4. Con:
  There are many lifestyles and decisions that parents enforce on their children that should, by the same token, also be considered as potentially abusive. Until these are universally recognised as abusive, it would be unjust to single out a vegan diet as such.

    1.4.1. Pro:
    Many parents force children to become followers of a religion and this practice is not considered as child abuse.

    1.4.2. Pro:
    There are already too many instances of unwise parental choices that are currently considered child abuse. Too many accusations could completely diminish the entire concept.

    1.4.3. Pro:
    If veganism is child abuse then so must other things, which are minor and will put a bad reputation of the caring parent who did nothing really bad enough to be called abuse to the child.

    1.4.4. Pro:
    The United Nations [20] does not consider veganism abusive, but rather cites it as one way to reduce mankind's negative impacts upon the climate and environment.

    1.4.5. Pro:
    Labeling loving parents who feed their children vegan diets as “child abusers” puts their children at risk of being put into foster care where much greater dangers exists.

  1.5. Pro:
  Children cannot understand the consequences of their parents' decisions about their diet. Therefore children should not be forced to follow said diet (as they cannot consent).

    1.5.1. Con:
    This is true of any lifestyle choice that a parent decides for their children, including feeding them a diet that contains animal products.

    1.5.2. Con:
    Until children are older, it is both necessary and essential for parents to make such decisions on their behalf: children, and even adolescents, cannot competently and consistently make reasoned decisions [21] for themselves (p.19).

      1.5.2.1. Con:
      The developing autonomy of children should be nurtured and respected rather than dismissed, as to do so aids emotional maturity and stability [22]. Thus, parents should involve their children in decisions about the latter's diet.

        1.5.2.1.1. Con:
        Developing autonomy does not mean that parents cannot set boundaries and restrictions.

  1.6. Con:
  Accusing a parent of child abuse opens a door to violate parental rights.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    In 2010, social services attempted to take custody of a family's 3-year-old son because he suffered malnutrition due to a vegetarian diet; the parents were assessed as psychologically normal and their other children were found healthy, yet there was a 2-year investigation [23] before they were removed from the at-risk register.

  1.7. Pro:
  The vegan movement is largely based on the idea that to be vegan is to protect animal rights. Human beings are also animals. Depriving an animal of foods they have evolved to eat by nature is a violation of their rights; thus, veganism may be said to abuse human rights in the name of protecting other animals' rights.

    1.7.1. Con:
    Saying that humans have a right to eat meat because we have evolved to do so is like saying humans have a right to have sex. This is obviously fallacious. We don't have a right to either, but can engage in it if all parties involved consents to it. No non-human animal has given consent to being killed. Therefore, we cannot ethically kill a non-human animal.

    1.7.2. Pro:
    Evidence suggests that the human body has adapted for digesting [24] both plants and animal products.

      1.7.2.1. Con:
      The human body is capable of digesting animal products, but does by no means require it. It is perfectly healthy to eat a plant-based diet.

        1.7.2.1.1. Pro:
        Homo Sapiens function as well, if not better, on a vegan diet [25]; meat consumption today is unnecessary to human survival or flourishing.

      1.7.2.2. Pro:
      Paranthropus robustus lived between 1 and 2.3 million years ago. Tooth wear analysis suggests this species mostly ate hard plant foods such as nuts, seeds, roots and tubers, typical of the African open savanna. Chemical analysis on the ratio of strontium to calcium in their teeth suggests however, that this species may have also included some meat in their diet [26].

      1.7.2.3. Con:
      That Homo Sapiens evolved as omnivores does not prove that they require meat then or today but rather that they adapted [27] over time to have maximum food options.

    1.7.3. Con:
    As the consumption of animal products carries significant health risks [28], to deny one's children these products is to care for their health, which seems the opposite of a human rights violation.

    1.7.4. Con:
    Vegans often cite environmental [29] and health [30] reasons for not being carnist [31].

  1.8. Pro:
  Labeling these parents as "child abusers" will prevent parents unwilling to do proper research into vegan nutrition from feeding their children vegan diets resulting in undernourishment.

    1.8.1. Pro:
    An article regarding Parenting and the Vegan Diet [32] explains common vegan diet deficiencies that children may experience on a vegan diet if parents do not think of creative and deliberate ways to compensate for them

    1.8.2. Con:
    This wrongly assumes that the status quo is an omnivorous diet which is adequately nutritious even without parents having researched how to make it so.

    1.8.3. Pro:
    Unless parents are regularly monitored with medical support, the Nutrition Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) [33] does not recommend veganism for children owing to the risk that they will develop deficiencies. (p. 4)

    1.8.4. Pro:
    The American Academy of Pediatrics and the German Nutrition Society [34] advise against a vegan diet in children due to the potential for children to become undernourished. (p. 4)

    1.8.5. Con:
    Labelling all these parents as "child abusers" would including some parents who do feed their children a perfectly fine diet, which is unfair to the parent.

"In more recent recommendations, the Nutrition Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) does not recommend this type of diet, but if the family so wishes, a dietary and medical framework with regular monitoring should be provided."

"The consumption of a vegan diet exposes the pediatric population to multiple nutritional deficiencies, in particular, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, calcium, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, and zinc. Several international scientific societies have therefore ruled on the recommendations concerning veganism in children. Consequently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the German Nutrition Society advise against a vegan diet in children."
