Kialo allows logged-in users to export discussions for private use.

We checked with the Kialo folks and confirmed that:
(1) it's ok for us to provide these data as part of the homework assignment
(2) you can export additional discussions yourself for use in your homework

If you want to use the data for other purposes, please ask Kialo at
support@kialo.com or https://support.kialo-edu.com/en/contact/ .
